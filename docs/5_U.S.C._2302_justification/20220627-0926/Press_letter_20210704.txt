Subject line: (5 U.S.C. 2302) Pandemics have been the #1 or #2 (after drugs) non-CBRN risk on DHS's list since 2011.  The SNS was empty and the Nation was unprepared because we suppressed those risk assessments.  We are still doing so.

Text:

Summary:  The DHS/FEMA Strategic National Risk Assessment (SNRA) is the science-based comparative national risk assessment of natural, accidental, and adversarial hazards that FEMA’s National Preparedness System is based on.   It has been locked up since 2011.  (The SNRA’s climate change analysis is the only Government climate study that I know of that has been suppressed by both parties.)  While classification and disagreements with DHS HQ had much to do with that before 2015, neither has been an obstacle since.  As far as I know, the decisions to suppress the science that FEMA's plans, requirements, and doctrine are based on have been made by DHS/FEMA itself since 2015.

I don’t have the moral credibility or communication skills to solve this problem inside the Government.  Everything I’ve tried has failed.  That is why I'm writing you now.

The context and documentation for the statements above is attached.  Larger files (all of which are already public information) are in https://bd02.github.io/external.  I will forward this to the committee staff I wrote to before, to my Department and agency, and to the addressees and cc-ed on the forwarded email below tomorrow.

I am not speaking for my Department or agency, any past or present DHS organization, or any past or present colleagues.

The unredacted information that these letters, attachments, and links communicate is explicitly within the scope of 5 U.S.C. § 2302, and communicated solely for its lawful purposes.

Thank you,
