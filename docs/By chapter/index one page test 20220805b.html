<h3>Event Background</h3>

<p>Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most devastating diseases affecting cloven-hoof animals such as cattle, swine, sheep and deer. The viral disease is highly contagious, with 7 types and more than 80 sub-types, and vaccination for one type does not confer immunity to the others. Additionally, the FMD virus can survive freezing temperatures but not temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius. <a href="#andx7">[7]</a>  Thus far, a pan-viral vaccination that would protect against all types has not been developed. FMD is easily transmitted and spreads rapidly through respiration and through contact with milk, semen, blood, saliva and feces. Pigs are particularly efficient amplifiers of the disease as they shed large amounts of virus into the air, while cattle are highly susceptible to the airborne-transmitted virus, owing to the large lung capacity and high volumes of air these animals respire. The FMD virus remains viable for long periods of time in both animate and inanimate objects and can be spread by contact with:</p>

<ul>

<li>Animals</li>

<li>Animal products, such as meat, milk, hides, skins and manure</li>

<li>Transport vehicles and equipment</li>

<li>Clothes and shoes</li>

<li>Hay, feed and other veterinary biologics</li>

<li>Human nasal passages and skin</li></ul>

<p>While there are no significant human health implications of FMD, an outbreak of the disease can have important economic impacts. FMD is found in 60 percent of the world’s countries and is endemic in many countries in South America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The international community values products that come from FMD-free countries and typically restricts trade in FMD-susceptible products from endemic countries or those affected by an ongoing outbreak. The Office International des Epizooties (OIE), an intergovernmental organization comprised of 158 member countries, was established in 1924 to guarantee the sanitary safety of world trade by developing rules for international trade in animals and animal products. OIE classifies member countries, or zones within countries, as being FMD-free with or without vaccination; the U.S. currently does not vaccinate for FMD and maintains an FMD-free without vaccination status. When an outbreak of FMD occurs in an FMD-free without vaccination country, OIE standards require that country wait 3 months after the last reported case of FMD when a “stamping out” approach has been used for eradication to apply for reinstatement of FMD-free status. If vaccination is used in the eradication process, the country cannot apply for reinstatement of FMD-free status until 3 months after the last vaccinated animal is slaughtered, or 6 months if the animal(s) are vaccinated and not slaughtered. In all cases, serological surveillance evidence must be submitted to prove the disease has been eradicated.</p>

<p>Given the value placed on FMD-free status, a confirmed case of FMD in the U.S. would result in an immediate restriction of exports. The current control strategy (9 CFR 53.4 Destruction of Animals with FMD) in USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulations to regain FMD-free status is to stamp out, or cull all infected and susceptible animals. <a href="#andx8">[8]</a> The APHIS Administrator has discretion to examine other options based on the size and/or extent of an outbreak.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p></p>

<h4>Economic Impact</h4>

<p>For this scenario, a potential introduction of the disease in California is considered. Although limited to one state, a single case of FMD can be considered a national-level event with repercussions across the country.</p>

<p>Carpenter et al <a href="#andx9">[9]</a> studied epidemic and economic impacts of FMD virus spread and control using epidemic simulation and economic optimization models. The simulated index herd was a single 2,000 cow dairy herd located in California. Although the initial infection was presumed to come from an FMD infected feral swine, similar results would come from any single infected animal introduced to the herd. Disease spread was limited to California, but economic impacts, including international trade effects, were felt throughout the U.S. There were five separate index detection delays examined, ranging from 7 to 22 days, with 100 iterations each. This led to a median economic impact estimated at $2.3-$69.0 billion, depending on the number of days delay until detection of disease. The “Low” and “High” estimates on economic burden are extrapolated from these numbers. Similarly direct costs and indirect costs are calculated from these totals. The indirect costs may be significantly higher given the variability in the potential costs listed above. The best case estimate is based on a detection delay of 14 days. This number is extremely difficult to estimate since the actual time from infection to diagnosis is impossible to ascertain.</p>

<p>The direct economic impact of an FMD outbreak will come from an immediate reduction in lost international trade as well as disease control and eradication efforts, which include the cost of:</p>

<ul>

<li>Maintenance of animal movement controls</li>

<li>Control areas</li>

<li>Intensified border inspections</li>

<li>Vaccines</li>

<li>Depopulation</li>

<li>Carcass disposal</li>

<li>Indemnification to farmers for losses</li>

<li>Disinfection and decontamination efforts</li></ul>

<p>Indirect costs can include:</p>

<ul><li>Impacts on local economies</li>

<li>Loss in upstream/downstream industries</li>

<li>Reduction in visitorship and tourism loss</li>

<li>Treatment of groundwater or other environmental remediation necessitated by carcass disposal or burning</li>

<li>Land value implications on animal disposal property</li>

<li>Changes in livestock and meat industry structure</li>

<li>Short term adjustments in meat consumption based on real or uncertain information <a href="#andx10">[10]</a></li></ul>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer. Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as the significant differences between temporary evacuations and permanent displacement due to property destruction are not captured.</p>

<ul>

<li>For the Animal Disease national-level event, the SNRA project team assumed a low estimate for social displacement of zero. <a href="#andx11">[11]</a></li>

<li>The best estimate of 1,000 was provided by subject matter experts from National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). <a href="#andx12">[12]</a>  Experts noted that those working on or near farms may be asked to relocate to reduce the chance of transmitting foot- and-mouth disease to other livestock.</li>

<li>A high estimate for social displacement was not determined for this event.</li></ul>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on significant distress and prolonged distress, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs; a factor elicited from subject matter experts weights the index for differing psychological impact based on the type of event, but as a secondary input. <a href="#andx13">[13]</a>  The numerical outputs of this index formula were used to assign events to bins of a risk matrix for a semi-quantitative analysis of psychological risk in the SNRA.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. Estimates are based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ul><li>Experts were elicited to provide estimates in the environmental impact category based on assumptions. Actual environmental/ecological harm that occurs as a result of the events described in a given scenario may vary considerably, and will depend on numerous variables (e.g., chemical or biological agent, contamination extent, persistence, toxicity—both chronic and acute toxicity—and infectivity).</li>

<li>EPA defined environmental consequence (impact) <a href="#andx14">[14]</a> as the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, or accidental chemical releases; energy use; or the depletion of natural resources.</li>

<li>Experts identified the best estimate for environmental impacts as “Low.” Experts indicated that the consequences could be higher depending on the acreage required for disposal of infected carcasses. Additionally, there is some potential for contamination to spread into wild animal populations.</li></ul>

<p></p>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>In the event that an FMD outbreak does occur in the U.S., there are four possible strategies for control and eradication of FMD in domestic livestock in the event of an outbreak. Each is supported by critical activities that include surveillance, biosecurity, decontamination, epidemiological activities, movement control, and communication. These four strategies are recognized by the OIE in Article 8.5.47 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2010): <a href="#andx15">[15]</a></p>

<ul>

<li>Stamping out or slaughter of all clinically affected and in-contact susceptible animals.</li>

<li>Stamping out, modified with emergency vaccination-to-slaughter, which includes slaughter of all clinically affected and in-contact susceptible animals and vaccination of at-risk animals, with subsequent slaughter of vaccinated animals.</li>

<li>Stamping out modified with emergency vaccination-to-live, which includes slaughter of all clinically infected and in-contact susceptible animals and vaccination of at-risk animals, without subsequent slaughter of vaccinated animals.</li>

<li>Vaccinate-to-live without stamping out. Vaccination used without slaughter of infected animals or subsequent slaughter of vaccinated animals.</li></ul>

<p>Many factors will be considered when determining whether a particular response strategy would be appropriate and advantageous. While no factor will independently dictate a response strategy, or a decision to employ emergency vaccination, there are many factors that will influence the decision of whether to vaccinate or not. Factors will include: <a href="#andx16">[16]</a></p>

<ul>

<li>Disruptions to interstate commerce</li>

<li>Disruptions to international trade</li>

<li>Acceptance of response strategy or strategies</li>

<li>Scale of outbreak</li>

<li>Rate of outbreak spread</li>

<li>FMD vaccine availability</li>

<li>Resources available to implement response strategies</li></ul>

<h3>Additional Relevant Information</h3>

<p>Similar to estimating the economic implications, establishing the frequency of an occurrence of FMD is difficult. An outbreak of FMD has not occurred in the U.S. since 1929, so any estimate of frequency or impact can only be based on data from other countries where recent outbreaks have occurred, as well as estimates based on models from current U.S. industry information. The United States has experienced nine known outbreaks of FMD from its first occurrence in 1870 to its final eradication in 1929, indicating a low frequency estimate of approximately 0.04, or 9 events in 235 years in the U.S. <a href="#andx17">[17]</a>, <a href="#andx18">[18]</a> The highest frequency of occurrence is an estimation based on the recent outbreaks during the previous decade in the United Kingdom, Japan and South Korea. DHS Office of Health Affairs experts estimate a high frequency of once per decade, or 0.1 in a given year. Since FMD is a highly communicable disease that is resilient and easily obtained, the SNRA project team selected 0.1 in a given year as the best estimate for this event.</p>

<p>While there is no historical data from the U.S. from which to estimate the cost of an FMD outbreak, there have been several outbreaks in other countries in the past decade which emphasize the severity of the impact. Examples of outbreaks include the following:</p>

<ul><li>In 2001, the United Kingdom (UK) suffered one of the largest FMD epidemics to occur in a developed country in several decades. Approximately 7 million animals were culled and their corpses burned on pyres. The outbreak devastated the nation's farming industry and cost the UK an estimated $11.9-$18.4 billion, including $4.8 billion in losses to agriculture, the food industry and the public sector, $4.2-$4.9 billion in lost tourism and $2.9-$3.4 billion in indirect losses. <a href="#andx19">[19]</a></li>

<li>The FMD outbreak in South Korea that occurred in late 2010 and ended in April of 2011 is estimated to have cost that country over $2.6 billion U.S. dollars and resulted in the loss of 3.47 million livestock. <a href="#andx20">[20]</a></li>

<li>Japan suffered a similar outbreak in 2010, which cost an estimated $3.14 billion U.S. The Japan and South Korea outbreaks are believed to have been caused by the same FMD virus serotype. The source of the Japan outbreak is believed to be contaminated wheat straw imported from China. <a href="#andx21">[21]</a></li></ul>

<p id="andx11">11.  Farm animals removed for euthanization as part of control efforts are not included in the SNRA’s measure of social displacement.</p>

<p id="andx12">12.  START is a Department of Homeland Security University Center of Excellence that focuses on social and behavioral aspects of terrorism, natural disasters, and technological accidents, and the social, behavioral, cultural and economic factors influencing responses to and recovery from catastrophes.</p>

<p id="andx13">13.  A Significant Distress Index is calculated from these inputs using a formula proposed by subject matter experts consulted for the SNRA project: <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> × (5 <i>Fat</i> + <i>Inj</i> + ½ <i>D</i>), where <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> represents the number of persons significantly distressed, <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> is the expert assessed Event Familiarity Factor, <i>Fat</i> is the number of fatalities, <i>Inj</i> is the number of injuries and/or illnesses, and <i>D</i> is the number of persons displaced (Social Displacement).  In words, this formula suggests that there are 5 significantly distressed persons for each life lost; 1 for each person injured; and 1 for each 2 people displaced.</p>

<p>This formula was constructed to reflect the empirical finding that the most severe stressor of a disaster is losing a loved one, followed by injury, followed by displacement. Uncertainty was captured by applying the index formula to the low, best, and high estimates of these three human impact metrics.</p>

<p>The Event Familiarity Factor is intended to capture the extent to which the event entails an ongoing threat with uncertainty regarding long term effects, is unfamiliar, or that people dread, exacerbating psychological impacts. This factor, ranging from 1.0 for familiar events to 1.3 for unfamiliar events, was provided by subject matter experts for each national-level event included in the SNRA: Animal Disease Outbreak was given a <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> of 1.0.</p>

<p>The numerical estimates calculated from this formula are reported in Appendix G. The semi-quantitative risk matrix is discussed in the Findings (Psychological Distress Risk).</p>

<p id="andx14">14.  The 2011 SNRA referred to impacts as ‘consequences’ because of prior usage in quantitative risk assessment (Kaplan and Garrick [1981, March], On the quantitative definition of risk: <i>Risk Analysis</i> 1(1) 11-32). Except where it will cause confusion, ‘impact’ is used synonymously in this document because of pre-existing connotations of the word ‘consequence’ within FEMA.</p>

<h3>Event Background</h3>

<p>The risk data estimated for this summary sheet are applicable to a contamination event (or a series of interconnected events) where a biological agent is accidentally or unintentionally introduced into the U.S. food supply resulting in national level public health impacts and product recalls. This event may include contamination of domestic food products, international food imports, or food products or ingredients that are utilized as a component of a supply chain. Such an incident may span multiple months as the investigation on the disease agent or contaminant is identified through laboratory analysis and traced to the product origin. This assessment only addresses outbreaks that result directly in harm to human health, and does not assess the impacts of crop or animal diseases, such as Foot and Mouth Disease in cattle, which could have catastrophic effects on the Nation. Nor does it address intentional contamination of the food supply by a terrorist; that risk is captured in a different National Level Event.</p>

<p>Data from the CDC’s Foodborne Outbreak Online Database (FOOD) <a href="#biofoodc10">[10]</a> were used to identify events that rose to a level of national significance. Data in FOOD come from CDC’s national Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System database. Most foodborne outbreaks are investigated by the state, local, territorial, and tribal health departments where the outbreak occurs. Outbreak information is then reported to CDC by the public health agency that conducted the investigation. CDC is only directly involved in outbreak investigations that involve more than one state, or are particularly large, or when the state or local health department requests assistance. Because of this only multistate outbreaks that resulted in reported hospitalizations of more than 100 persons were considered to be National Level Events. There have been seven such events between 1998 and 2008, the years included in FOOD.</p>

<p>The best-estimate frequency is the average frequency of occurrence of this set of events in the selected eleven year period. The low frequency is the inverse of the longest time interval between outbreaks in this set (5 years); the high frequency is the greatest number of outbreaks which occurred in one year (two, in 2006).</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<h4>Fatalities and Illnesses</h4>

<p>The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate health and safety impacts resulting from an accidental biological food contamination event:</p>

<ul>

<li>Outbreaks included in FOOD report a number of illnesses and fatalities. These reported numbers are known to be low because they do not account for underreporting or underdiagnosis. Consequently, the reported numbers were adjusted using the latest multipliers provided by the CDC.</li>

<li>Fatalities were increased by a factor of two, while illnesses were increased with the following multipliers:</li>

</ul>

<h4>Economic Loss</h4>

<p>The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate economic impacts resulting from an accidental biological food contamination event:</p>

<ul><li>For each of the seven outbreaks, the costs of lost productivity due to illness as well as medical costs were calculated using the USDA Economic Research Service’s Foodbome Illness Cost Calculator, with the Value of Statistical Life reset to $0.</li></ul>

</table>

<p>Business interruption costs could be determined for only one event. However, its magnitude indicated that the unknown business interruption cost estimates for other events were likely to dominate total direct costs. As a representative range of total costs could not be determined for additional data points, the SNRA project team elected not to report economic impacts for the Biological Food Contamination event.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer. Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as the significant differences between temporary evacuations and&nbsp;permanent displacement due to property destruction are not captured.</p>

<ul>

<li>Social displacement estimates for the accidental Biological Food Contamination event were provided by staff researchers and subject matter experts at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). <a href="#biofoodc14">[14]</a></li>

<li>The low and best estimates of 0 and 400 respectively reflect expert judgment. The high estimate of 950 is a judgment based on a historic incident where contamination of the water by <i>E. coli</i> in the Ontario community of Kashechewan forced the evacuation of the town. <a href="#biofoodc15"> [15]</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on <em>significant distress</em> and <em>prolonged distress</em>, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs; a factor elicited from subject matter experts weights the index for differing psychological impact based on the type of event, but as a secondary input. <a href="#biofoodc15"> [15]</a> The numerical outputs of this index formula were used to assign events to bins of a risk matrix for a semi-quantitative analysis of psychological risk in the SNRA.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. Estimates are based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Experts were elicited to provide estimates in the environmental impact category based on assumptions. Actual environmental/ecological harm that occurs as a result of the events described in a given scenario may vary considerably, and will depend on numerous variables (e.g., as chemical or biological agents, contamination extent, persistence, toxicity—both chronic and acute toxicity—and infectivity).</li>

<li>EPA defined environmental consequence (impact) as the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, or accidental chemical releases; energy use; or the depletion of natural resources.</li>

<li>Experts identified the best estimate for environmental impacts as “Moderate.” Moderate impacts would most likely result from either waste disposal (e.g., disposing of the contaminated food supply) or dissemination of an infectious agent through some type of accidental application (e.g., pesticide application on crops). In either event, the result could be the introduction of a non-native pathogen into native species, thus causing extinction and permanent change to the ecosystem if disseminated over a wide geographic area. If the agent infects only humans, the environmental/ecological risk would be “Low.” There may also be increased environmental/ecological risk if the food production cycle were disrupted. Changing the mechanisms of food production could increase the environmental/ecological risk.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>The impacts caused by an accidental introduction of an infectious agent into the food supply can be mitigated through several preparedness strategies. Effective investigative capability, early warning systems and emergency information dissemination are necessary to rapidly detect contamination, locate its source and notify the public of the event and necessary safety measures. Monitoring and warning systems should be regularly tested to ensure that they are functioning properly when an event occurs. Further, a properly prepared and deployed response team could potentially aid in containing the spread of the contamination.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p id="biofoodc1">1.&nbsp; Low, average, and high adjusted fatalities of the set of multistate outbreaks with 100 or more reported hospitalizations between 1998 and 2008 from the CDC FOOD database. Reported fatalities were multiplied by a factor of 2 to compensate for underreporting (see text).</p>

<p id="biofoodc2">2.&nbsp; Low, average, and high adjusted illnesses from the set of events described in note <a href="#biofoodc1">[1]</a>. Reported illnesses were multiplied by the CDC’s recommended multipliers (see Table 2 below) to compensate for underdiagnosis and underreporting.</p>

<p id="biofoodc3">3.&nbsp; The SNRA project team judged that the single data point calculated (see text) was insufficient to determine a representative range of economic impact estimates for this event.</p>

<p id="biofoodc4">4.&nbsp; The SNRA measure of Social Displacement is the number of people displaced from their homes for two or more days.</p>

<p id="biofoodc5">5.&nbsp; Low and best estimates of 0 and 400 respectively reflect expert judgment. The high estimate of 950 is a judgment based on a historic incident where contamination of the water by <i>E. coli</i> in the Ontario community of Kashechewan forced the evacuation of the town (see discussion for references).</p>

<p id="biofoodc6">6.&nbsp; The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. The comments and rankings presented in this Risk Summary Sheet have not undergone review by the EPA and only represent the opinions of the group. Estimates pertain to the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment; they are grouped into high, moderate, low, and de minimus (none) categories.</p>

<p id="biofoodc7">7.&nbsp; In 2011, the U. S.

Note that contamination of the food supply is likely to cause minimal displacement.</p>

<p id="biofoodc16">16.&nbsp; The Significant Distress Index is calculated from these inputs using a formula proposed by experts consulted for the SNRA project: <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> × (5 <i>Fat</i> + <i>Inj</i> + ½ <i>D</i>), where <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> represents the number of persons significantly distressed, <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> is the expert assessed Event Familiarity Factor, <i>Fat</i> is the number of fatalities, <i>Inj</i> is the number of injuries and/or illnesses, and <i>D</i> is the number of persons displaced (Social Displacement). In words, this formula suggests that there are 5 significantly distressed persons for each life lost; 1 for each person injured; and 1 for each 2 people displaced. This formula was constructed to reflect the empirical finding that the most severe stressor of a disaster is losing a loved one, followed by injury, followed by displacement. Uncertainty was captured by applying the index formula to the low, best, and high estimates of these three human impact metrics.</p>

<p>The Event Familiarity Factor is intended to capture the extent to which the event entails an ongoing threat with uncertainty regarding long term effects, is unfamiliar, or that people dread, exacerbating psychological impacts. This factor, ranging from 1.0 for familiar events to 1.3 for unfamiliar events, was provided by subject matter experts for each national-level event included in the SNRA: Accidental Biological Food Contamination was given a <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> of 1.0.</p>

<p>The numerical estimates calculated from this formula are reported in Appendix G. The semi-quantitative risk matrix is discussed in the Findings (Psychological Distress Risk).</p>

<p id="biofoodc17">17.&nbsp; The 2011 SNRA referred to impacts as ‘consequences’ because of prior usage in quantitative risk assessment (Kaplan and Garrick [1981, March], On the quantitative definition of risk: <i>Risk Analysis</i> 1(1) 11-32). Except where it will cause confusion, ‘impact’ is used synonymously in this document because of pre-existing connotations of the word ‘consequence’ within FEMA.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The results for this analysis indicate an extremely low risk associated with combustible/ flammable cargoes transported by rail. However, this conclusion is tied to the assumptions which determine the scope of the event, the selection and interpretation of data, and the choice of results to be reported; and these limitations must be understood before using these results. The scoping of this hazard to only incidents resulting in fatalities may have resulted in an assessment that does not adequately address factors that affect risk. Additionally, the use of historic data depends upon the assumption that the future will resemble the past: with respect to combustible/ flammable rail cargo accidents, recent changes in the volume of cargo suggest that the use of historic data may not adequately describe current risk. Furthermore, the SNRA project team believes that the limitation of the current SNRA displacement metric to displacements of 48 hours or more may exclude information important to the characterization of this hazard.</p>

<p>The SNRA project team believes that the effects of these recognized limitations (which are shared by other technological/accidental hazards in the SNRA) upon the final reported estimates may be significant. To better understand the risk from this hazard, the SNRA project team recommends further analysis that includes all factors included in the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) data.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Recent rail accidents involving combustible/flammable cargoes such as Bakken crude oil have raised concerns about this hazard among many people in the U.S. <a href="#boomboom5">[5]</a>  Increases in the volume of Bakken crude oil transported by rail coupled with high -profile accidents like the Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, Canada accident, have been major factors in driving this concern and risk perception. <a href="#boomboom6">[6]</a>  Although the Lac-Mégantic accident falls outside of the scope of the SNRA because it occurred in Canada, the images associated with this accident still affect perception in the U.S. The Lac- Mégantic accident, which resulted in 47 fatalities, represents an actual worst-case scenario involving combustible/flammable rail cargoes. <a href="#boomboom7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Five other dramatic accidents involving the rail transport of combustible substances occurred in 2014: although none resulted in fatalities, they further bolstered perceptions that rail shipments of combustible/flammable materials pose a risk of real risk.</p>

<p>However, as with other risks, the perception of risk often differs from the actual probability and likely impacts of risk. <a href="#boomboom8">[8]</a>  For example, the PHMSA data from 1980 through 2014 that was leveraged for the 2015 SNRA contains only four accidents in the U.S. involving at least one fatality. Moreover, none of those incidents caused more than one fatality, or resulted in impacts on the other SNRA measures of impact comparable to those of many other accidental and natural hazards studied in the SNRA. <a href="#boomboom9">[9]</a>  Consequently, the relative risk of a fatal accident involving combustible/flammable cargoes may not necessarily match the perception of risk.</p>

<p>Prior to using results from the SNRA to inform a decision with significant impacts in the real world, it is important for end users to review the underlying data and fully understand its limitations.</p>

<h3>Event Background</h3>

<p>The recent advent of the shale oil boom in the U.S. and accidents involving rail cargoes of Bakken crude oil have raised concern over the hazards of such cargoes. <a href="#boomboom10">[10]</a>  In 2013, over 462,000 barrels of oil where shipped by rail out of North Dakota, one of several states with crude oil production. <a href="#boomboom11">[11]</a>  In the U.S., rail companies transported approximately 435,560 carloads of crude oil in 2013. From 2012 to 2014 (the last full year for data), four accidents occurred in the U.S. involving rail cargoes of crude oil. <a href="#boomboom12">[12]</a>  However, accidents involving crude oil cargos from 1980–2014 represent approximately 0.09 percent of all incidents. <a href="#boomboom13">[13]</a>  Alcohol N.O.S. <a href="#boomboom14">[14]</a> cargoes represented 0.8 percent of all incidents or 977 incidents out of over 13,000. <a href="#boomboom15">[15]</a>  Additionally, alcohol N.O.S. and crude oil represent two of the approximately 180 different flammable or combustible commodities represented in the set of incidents reported to PHMSA in the 1980-2014 period included in the SNRA analysis. <a href="#boomboom16">[16]</a></p>

<p>Aside from the type of cargo, the PHMSA data provided information on what failed (e.g. valve failed) that resulted in the release of the cargo. Three of the four events analyzed involved the failure of the container. <a href="#boomboom17">[17]</a>  Three of the failures resulted from accident damage from a collision. <a href="#boomboom18">[18]</a></p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>All data used to develop the risk analysis came from the publically available PHMSA database. The PHMSA database includes incident information from several modes of transportation including aviation and rail. The scope of this report includes rail incidents involving cargoes with hazardous class noun names that include combustible, explosive, or flammable. <a href="#boomboom19">[19]</a>  Cargoes that fall within the scope previously described include crude oil (e.g., Bakken crude), xylene, ethanol, etc. <a href="#boomboom20">[20]</a>  In addition to the restrictions to rail and to specific cargoes, the scope of the SNRA Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) was limited to incidents involving at least one fatality related to the cargo.</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>

<p>The following are the parameters for data inclusion for the analysis:</p>

<ol>

<li>Data set only includes incidents occurring within the U.S., U.S. territories, and possessions. <a href="#boomboom21">[21]</a></li>

<li>Incidents must include at least one fatality.</li>

<li>Direct economic estimates were converted to 2011 dollars to allow for comparison with the existing SNRA 2011 data set.</li>

<li>Displacement data must be from incidents with displacements of 48 hours or longer.</li>

<li>Incidents only involve rail as a means of transportation.</li>

<li>The analysis included incidents that use combustible, explosive, or flammable in the hazard noun name. <a href="#boomboom22">[22]</a></li>

<li>To ensure data compatibility, to include but not limited to data collection methods and data collection standards, only PHMSA data is used.</li>

<li>Incidents only cover full years of data from 1980 to 2014.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Specific Assumptions</h4>

<p>The following are assumptions used for this analysis:</p>

<ol>

<li>The scope of the SNRA 2015 Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) event allows for a meaningful representation of the risk to the Nation from this hazard.</li>

<li>Factors not included in the analysis do not produce statistically significant affects that could change the analysis.</li>

<li>The SNRA metric for psychological distress is a valid and meaningful measure for comparison among hazards, within the order of magnitude precision and generic limitations of the SNRA.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Data Cleaning</h4>

<p>Data cleaning involved two specific measures. First, data cleaning involved the elimination of multiple lines of data that did not contain unique quantitative data. Second, data cleaning also included removing records that did not include a cargo with noun names falling within the scope of the analysis.</p>

<h4>Frequency</h4>

<p>From 1980 to 2014, a span of 35 years, only four incidents occurred that resulted in at least one fatality (SNRA minimum threshold for inclusion of a risk) due to the cargo out of over 13,000 incidents. All four incidents involved different cargoes.</p>

<p>Low, best, and high annual frequency estimates represent the 5th, mean, and 95th percentile of the frequency distribution based upon an assumption of a Poisson (random and independently occurring) process and four observations in 35 years. <a href="#boomboom23">[23]</a>  The resulting low, best, and high estimates of 0.039, 0.114, and 0.222 incidents per year for a fatal combustible/flammable cargo rail accident are relatively low in comparison with many other hazards in the SNRA, including chemical (toxic inhalational hazard) accidents, dam failures, and the majority of the SNRA natural hazards.</p>

<h4>Health and Safety</h4>

<p>The analysis of the four incidents resulted in an average of one fatality, given the occurrence of an incident resulting in any fatalities. Although the average (expected value) of the set was used as the best estimate for consistency with other hazards analyzed in the SNRA, for the Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) this value of one fatality was also the most likely value (mode) of the set. Injuries ranged from 0 to 52, with an average of 20.</p>

<h4>Economic Impacts</h4>

<h5>Direct Economic Impacts</h5>

<p>Direct economic impacts as defined in the SNRA include decontamination, disposal, and physical destruction costs including property (structure, contents, physical infrastructure and other physical property) and crop damage; one year’s lost spending due to fatalities; medical costs; and business interruption directly resulting from the impacts of an event.</p>

<p>Direct economic impacts for the set of incidents meeting the threshold criteria of this SNRA event ranged from $42,500 to $2,886,612, with an average of $904,994, according to the measure of direct economic impact used by the SNRA. <a href="#boomboom24">[24]</a></p>

<h5>Indirect Economic Impacts <a href="#boomboom24">[25]</a></h5>

<p>Direct economic losses alone do not represent the full picture of the economic impacts to the Nation from a disaster or attack. Indirect and induced economic losses can be substantially larger than the direct economic losses that occur in the aftermath of an event.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Indirect economic impacts</b> include costs incurred by the suppliers and vendors in the associated expenditure sectors for the industries impacted by the direct costs. Indirect impacts also include positive offsets due to increased spending within sectors impacted by the direct costs. <a href="#boomboom26">[26]</a></li>

<li><b>Induced economic impacts</b> include those incurred due to reduced spending by households with members employed in any of the directly or indirectly affected industries. Induced impacts can also include substitution effects or likely transfers of economic activity from one set of sectors to another set, such as avoidance of air or other travel or altered transportation mode preferences to other sectors following an attack on the commercial air transport sector.</li>

</ul>

<p>Highly mature economic models exist for calculating estimates of indirect and induced economic losses for natural disasters, human and animal pandemics, technological accidents, terrorist attacks, and cyber events. However, there is at present no generally agreed or practical method for translating estimates produced by these disparate models into a single measure which can be meaningfully compared across all of the threats and hazards of the SNRA in a defensible fashion. Because such a measure would yield data of great value for multiple purposes beyond the context of the SNRA and similar assessments, it has been among the highest risk research priorities for DHS and its academic Centers of Excellence for over a decade. Should these efforts prove successful in coming years, the next iteration of the SNRA will include comparisons of total economic loss to the Nation across all of its threats and hazards.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer. Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as the significant differences between temporary evacuations and permanent displacement due to property destruction are not captured.</p>

<p>For the limited data set of historical observations resulting in one or more fatalities, no incident resulted in a displacement of populations for 48 hours or longer.</p>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on significant distress and prolonged distress, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. <a href="#boomboom27">[27]</a>  The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs. A multiplicative factor elicited from subject matter experts weights the index for differing psychological impact based on the type of event, but as a secondary input.</p>

<p>The Significant Distress Index is calculated from these inputs using a formula proposed by subject matter experts consulted for the SNRA project: <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> × (5 <i>Fat</i> + <i>Inj</i> + ½ <i>D</i>), where <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> represents the number of persons significantly distressed, <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> is the expert assessed Event Familiarity Factor, <i>Fat</i> is the number of fatalities, <i>Inj</i> is the number of injuries and/or illnesses, and <i>D</i> is the number of persons displaced (Social Displacement).</p>

<ul>

<li>In words, this formula suggests that there are 5 significantly distressed persons for each life lost; 1 for each person injured; and 1 for each 2 people displaced. This formula was constructed to reflect the empirical finding that the most severe stressor of a disaster is losing a loved one, followed by injury, followed by displacement.</li>

<li>The Event Familiarity Factor is intended to capture the extent to which the event entails an ongoing threat with uncertainty regarding long-term effects, is unfamiliar, or that people dread, exacerbating psychological impacts. This factor, ranging from 1.0 for familiar events to 1.3 for unfamiliar events, was provided by subject matter experts for each national-level event included in the SNRA.</li>

<li>Uncertainty was captured by applying the index formula to the low, best, and high estimates of these three human impact metrics.</li>

</ul>

<p>The numerical outputs of this index formula were used to assign events to bins of a risk matrix for a semi-quantitative analysis of psychological risk in the SNRA.</p>

<p>The Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) hazard event was added by the SNRA project subsequent to the 2011 iteration of the SNRA for which Event Familiarity Factors were elicited from subject matter experts. The SNRA project team assigned a provisional Event Familiarity Factor of 1.0 by analogy with other natural and accidental hazards in the existing SNRA, for the calculation of provisional psychological distress estimates. It must be stressed that this assignment has not been reviewed by the 2011 subject matter experts.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>

<p>The SNRA environmental impact estimate, which was assessed in calendar year 2011 for the 23 original national-level events of the 2011 SNRA by subject matter experts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), could not be assessed for the Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) hazard event which was added to the SNRA in calendar year 2015. A future iteration of the SNRA will assess the environmental impacts of this event on measures comparable with other SNRA threat and hazard events.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Based upon the scope of the SNRA analysis and the specific data set selected by the SNRA project, the overall risk from a rail incident involving combustible/flammable cargoes is comparatively low on every measure of risk assessed in the SNRA, relative to other threats and hazards in the existing SNRA data set.</p>

<p>Combustible/flammable cargo rail accidents resulting in fatalities have historically occurred only once every 10 years on average in the U.S., within the 1980–2014 historical observation period of the SNRA analysis. None of the four incidents meeting this threshold resulted in mass fatalities. Additionally, none of the incidents resulted in impacts on any other impact scale, which would meet the minimum threshold of inclusion for any other existing hazard in the SNRA. Although any such assessment must be made in recognition of the significant limitations of the SNRA methodology when leveraging historical data—particularly in view of recent evidence in a neighboring country of this hazard’s potential to cause catastrophic mass fatality accidents—the differences in risk across impact measures between this hazard and other SNRA hazards sharing the same data and methodological limitations and constraints are striking.</p>

<p>Objectively, these differences are greater than the order of magnitude considered to be the minimum resolution for risk judgments in the SNRA.</p>

<h4>Fatalities and Illnesses/Injuries</h4>

<p>The data set of over 13,000 incidents indicates that fatalities due to the cargo as opposed to fatalities due to collisions are uncommon. <a href="#boomboom28">[28]</a>  Additionally, injuries are relatively rare with only 149 out of over 13,000 incidents involving an injury. <a href="#boomboom29">[29]</a></p>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>The methodological approach for psychological distress used in the SNRA represents a first attempt to include psychological impacts in a strategic, national-level risk assessment focused on national preparedness. While this approach is straightforward and transparent, it also has important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the psychological distress results:</p>

<p>Additional analysis is required to verify and validate this approach, and the sensitivity of the results to the selection of weights in the formula should also be explored. Experts consulted about psychological impacts emphasized extreme caution in using the SNRA’s measure of psychological distress, and the need for additional research. <a href="#boomboom30">[30]</a></p>

<ol>

<li>Quantitative assessments of psychological factors generally involve an extreme level of complexity requiring specific controls. The methodological approach for psychological distress used in the SNRA does not include controls for factors such as preexisting psychological conditions, gender, age, culture, or other significant factors.</li>

<li>The index approach currently does not include a component for translating economic losses into psychological distress. If estimates of homes destroyed and jobs lost (rather than overall direct economic losses) are obtained as impact estimates for various national-level events, it would be possible to capture financial loss as part of the equation for psychological distress in future iterations of the SNRA.</li>

<li>The current social displacement measure (counting people as displaced if they are forced to leave home for two or more days) does not differentiate between short term displacement (i.e., short-term evacuation) and long-term permanent displacement (i.e., the home is destroyed). Ideally, the psychological impact index would differentiate these two types of displacement, because the long term displacement is much more impactful for “significant distress” and “prolonged distress” psychological impacts.</li>

<li>The duration of distress is an important factor which is not considered in the current approach. Most people do recover over time, although individuals vary greatly in the speed with which they rebound.</li>

<li>The psychometrics for the measure of psychological distress used in the SNRA is unknown.</li>

</ol>

<p>The SNRA approach represents the first attempt to include psychological impacts in a DHS strategic, national-level risk assessment. However, the approach and inputs have not been extensively verified and validated by the broader community of academic researchers focused on psychosocial effects of disasters. As with all of the methodology and analysis introduced by the 2011 and 2015 iterations of the SNRA, the psychological distress estimates should be considered provisional pending full peer and stakeholder review.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>The limitation of the SNRA combustible/flammable rail accident hazard event to only those incidents with a fatality and displacements of 48 or more hours resulted in no cases of social displacement by the measure used in the SNRA. Expanding the data set to include incidents without a fatality added only two incidents with displacement of 48 or more hours. <a href="#boomboom31">[31]</a>  However, when the incident set parameters included all cases of displacement, only 139 of over 13,000 incidents included a displacement, <a href="#boomboom32">[32]</a>  or less than 0.1 percent of all incidents.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>

<p>Although the SNRA measure of environmental impact could not be assessed for the Combustible/Flammable Cargo Accident (Rail) event in the 2015 SNRA, the project team examined other measures and indicators of environmental impact. The SNRA project team used reports from the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), and PHMSA in the qualitative analysis.</p>

<p>The concentration of oil released in a relatively small area, when transported by rail, could result in a serious environmental impact. <a href="#boomboom33">[33]</a>  Spills from rail cargoes for the analyzed data set range from 500 liquid gallons (LGA) to 31,856 LGA. <a href="#boomboom34">[34]</a>  However, while large, these quantities pale in comparison to the Exxon Valdez spill (10.92 million LGA) and the largest pipeline spill (1.68 million LGA). <a href="#boomboom35">[35]</a>  Although volume of spill represents only one factor that affects environmental impacts, it still provides a means for comparing effects. By this measure, the environmental impacts of rail spills in the historical data set used by the SNRA are small by comparison with historical spills from other forms of transportation.</p>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>Several factors could mitigate higher potential fatality and injury rates such as speed limits in more populous areas, which would mitigate catastrophic accidents. For example, the Lac- Mégantic accident occurred in part due to the train traveling in excess of 65 MPH into a corner rated for 35 MPH. <a href="#boomboom36">[36]</a>  Thus, speed limits in populous areas may reduce fatality or injury risk for this hazard event.</p>

<h3>Limitations and Other Recommendations</h3>

<p>The limited scope of this assessment does not adequately address specific risks from specific cargoes. In addition, the lack of prior studies focused on specific cargoes limited the ability of the SNRA project team to compare different types of cargo. Different cargoes do present different specific hazards and risks. However, the SNRA analysis indicates that the transportation of any form of combustible/flammable cargo by rail presents comparatively low risks on all SNRA impact measures, within the limitations of the SNRA method and the historic incident data set leveraged by the SNRA.</p>

<p>The SNRA does not indicate what variables may have been mitigating what may be an otherwise substantial, but unknown, risk from some very dangerous cargoes. The SNRA project team was unable, within the compressed timeframe of the 2015 SNRA, to locate sufficient data or prior analysis to indicate whether it is predominately a single variable (e.g., speed limits), or combinations of factors, that have mitigated the historic likelihood of catastrophic incidents by this modality.</p>

<p>Future research should include specific efforts into variable analysis to help develop an understanding of which variables mitigate hazards. Such an effort could help identify single points of failure if they exist. However, any effort to study the different variables would likely need to be a more complex analysis, using advanced statistical methods such as stepwise regression analysis.</p>

<p>Additional unknowns which the SNRA analysis indicated as important for further research:</p>

<ul>

<li>Risk factors such as speed limits, because of the potential to provide significant insight into risks associated with rail cargoes.</li>

<li>Risk factors other than type of cargo, such as rail infrastructure.</li>

</ul>

<p>As with all analysis and findings conducted for the SNRA, any further analytic efforts should include a scientific peer review process to mitigate potential bias, and ensure that the results are valid and reliable.</p>

<p>This table shows the minimum, average, and maximum values for frequencies and impacts associated with the direct impacts of national-level droughts. <a href="#droughtref8">[8]</a> The event set evaluated was from 1980 to 2014 and contained a total of 22 droughts that met the $1 billion threshold. This analysis did not specifically include consideration for climate scenarios often associated with drought events (e.g. heat waves, reduction in precipitation and snowpack).</p>

<h3>Event Background</h3>

<p>The SNRA Drought National-level Event was originally developed by the DHS Office of Policy for the 2012–13 Homeland Security National Risk Characterization (HSNRC) project, a cooperative effort of the DHS analytic enterprise, to expand the 2011 SNRA risk knowledge base to additional threats and hazards relevant to national preparedness. The HSNRC data and analysis were updated and revised by Argonne National Laboratory in support of the 2015 SNRA.</p>

<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) defines drought as a deficiency in precipitation over an extended period, usually a season or more, resulting in a water shortage causing adverse impacts on vegetation, animals, and/or people. Drought is a temporary aberration from normal climatic conditions; thus it can vary significantly from one region to another. <a href="#droughtref9">[9]</a>  It is a normal, recurrent feature of climate that occurs in virtually all climate zones. However, drought conditions can be caused by human interaction with the natural world.</p>

<p>Drought characteristics include large-scale drying trends in precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture fields. The impacts of a drought result from the interplay between the natural event (less precipitation than expected) and the demand people place on the water supply.</p>

<p>While droughts and heat waves can occur at the same time, they are separate meteorological events and are treated as separate hazard events in the SNRA.</p>

<p>The duration of droughts can vary greatly. For instance, there are cases when drought conditions develop relatively quickly and lasts a very short period of time, exacerbated by extreme heat and/or wind, and there are other cases when drought spans multiple years, or even decades.</p>

<p>Drought differs from other natural hazards in at least two significant ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>The onset and end of a drought can be difficult to determine. The effects of a drought can accumulate slowly, and may linger even after the apparent termination of an episode.</li>

<li>Unlike most natural hazards, drought impacts are less obvious, and are spread over a larger geographic area.</li></ul>

<p>During severe droughts, agricultural crops do not mature, wildlife and livestock are undernourished, land values decline, and unemployment increases. Droughts can cause a shortage of water for human and agricultural consumption, hydroelectric power, recreation, and navigation. Water quality may decline and the number and severity of wildfires may increase. <a href="#droughtref10">[10]</a></p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<ul><li>For the purpose of the SNRA, a national-level drought is defined as a drought producing direct economic loss in excess of $1 billion dollars.</li>

<li>A 35-year time period, from Jan 1, 1980 to Dec 31, 2014, was used to estimate the inter- arrival rates/frequencies and impacts for droughts exceeding the $1 billion threshold. A full list of aggregated drought events used for this report is located in Table 1.</li>

<li>The Data Summary table reports the maximum, average, and minimum frequency with which such droughts occurred in the United States, and the maximum, average and minimum impacts for fatalities, injuries, and direct economic losses associated with droughts in the data set.</li>

<li>Mean global drought conditions were not directly considered in this assessment. The focus of this analysis was limited to the climatic regions within the contiguous United States.</li></ul>

<h4>Frequency</h4>

<p>For purposes of the SNRA, drought risk is based on historical weather and climate disasters reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)’s National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) for the Billion Dollar Disaster List. <a href="#droughtref11">[11]</a>  The best-estimate frequency is the average frequency of occurrence of droughts in the selected 35-year period. The low frequency is the inverse of the longest inter-arrival time in the data set (the longest number of years that two droughts are spaced apart); the high frequency is the inverse of the shortest inter-arrival time in the data set (the shortest number of years that two incidents are spaced apart).</p>

<h4>Health & Safety</h4>

<p>There were no fatalities or illness/injuries directly linked to the droughts in this data set. <a href="#droughtref12">[12]</a>  In the developed world, widespread drought-related deaths are rare in the modern era. However, increasing drought conditions in developed countries such as the United States can have significant direct and indirect impact to food supplies which may put populations at risk. <a href="#droughtref13">[13]</a></p>

<h4>Economic</h4>

<h5>Direct Economic Impacts</h5>

<p>Direct economic impacts as defined in the SNRA include decontamination, disposal, and physical destruction costs including property (structure, contents, physical infrastructure, and other physical property) and crop damage; one year’s lost spending due to fatalities; medical costs; and business interruption directly resulting from the impacts of an event. The direct economic loss estimates of the Billion Dollar Disaster List were used for the 2015 SNRA without modification because of the close similarity of its direct economic loss estimation methodology with that of the SNRA. <a href="#droughtref14">[14]</a></p>

<p>In performing these disaster cost assessments, NCDC gathers the statistics from a wide variety of sources. <a href="#droughtref15">[15]</a>  The total estimated costs of these events are the costs in terms of dollars that would not have been incurred had the event not taken place. Insured and uninsured losses are included in damage estimates. Sources include the NWS, FEMA, U.S. Department of Agriculture, other U.S. Government agencies, individual state emergency management agencies, state and regional climate centers, media reports, and insurance industry estimates. <a href="#droughtref16">[16]</a>
‎
<p>For the NCDC source list, economic drought damages were inflated to a 2014 dollar value using average changes in the Consumer Price Index. In total, 22 droughts exceeding the $1 billion threshold are aggregated in the findings of this report. Low, best, and high estimates for direct economic loss are the historical minimum, average, and maximum for the event set, adjusted to 2011 dollars for comparison with the existing SNRA data set. <a href="#droughtref17">[17]</a></p>

<p>The total loss for the 22 events was $201 billion (see Table 1 for a full breakdown of cost per event). The historical high for economic losses was the 1988 drought at $38 billion [2014 $40 billion], which was rated as one of the nation's worst in the past 100 years. The 1988 drought impacted large portions of the U.S. with very severe losses to agriculture and related industries. Barge traffic on the lower Mississippi River was stopped during June and July 1988 as a result of record low flows caused by drought conditions throughout most of the Mississippi Basin. <a href="#droughtref18">[18]</a>  Five separate drought events (1993, 1996, 2005, 2006, and 2014) all reported the historical low for economic loss at $2 billion. The average economic impact is $8.7 billion [2014 $9.1 billion] per event. The largest gap between drought events of two years occurred twice during the event set—between 1980 and 1983, and again between 1993 and 1996.</p>

<h5>Indirect Economic Impacts <a href="#droughtref19">[19]</a></h5>

<p>Direct economic losses alone do not represent the full picture of the economic impacts to the Nation from a disaster or attack. Indirect and induced economic losses can be substantially larger than the direct economic losses that occur in the aftermath of an event.</p>

<ul><li>Indirect economic impacts include costs incurred by the suppliers and vendors in the associated expenditure sectors for the industries impacted by the direct costs. Indirect impacts also include positive offsets due to increased spending within sectors impacted by the direct costs. <a href="#droughtref20">[20]</a></li>

<li>Induced economic impacts include those incurred due to reduced spending by households with members employed in any of the directly or indirectly affected industries. Induced impacts can also include substitution effects or likely transfers of economic activity from one set of sectors to another set, such as avoidance of air or other travel or altered transportation mode preferences to other sectors following an attack on the commercial air transport sector.</ul>

<p>Highly mature economic models exist for calculating estimates of indirect and induced economic losses for natural disasters, human and animal pandemics, technological accidents, terrorist attacks, and cyber events. However, there is at present no generally agreed or practical method for translating estimates produced by these disparate models into a single measure which can be meaningfully compared across all of the threats and hazards of the SNRA in a defensible fashion. Because such a measure would yield data of great value for multiple purposes beyond the context of the SNRA and similar assessments, it has been among the highest risk research priorities for DHS and its academic Centers of Excellence for over a decade. Should these efforts prove successful in coming years, the next iteration of the SNRA will include comparisons of total economic loss to the Nation across all of its threats and hazards.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer. By this measure, social displacement was assessed to be zero as a result of national level droughts. <a href="#droughtref21">[21]</a></p>

<p>Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as permanent migration due to job loss or lack of opportunities from a hazard such as drought are not captured through this measure. For instance, during the Dust Bowl in the 1930’s, millions of people migrated from the drought areas, often heading west, in search of work. <a href="#droughtref22">[22]</a></p>

<h4>Psychological Impacts</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on significant distress and prolonged distress, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs. <a href="#droughtref23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Fatalities and injuries associated with historical heat wave/drought events were counted under the Heat Wave event by definition, and as noted above the assessed displacement was zero. As the SNRA psychological distress index is derived from the human health and displacement impact estimates, this measure reflects de minimus psychological distress impacts for the SNRA 2015 Drought event.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impacts</h4>

<p>The environmental impact estimate, which was assessed for the 23 original national-level events of the 2011 SNRA by subject matter experts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), could not be assessed for the Drought event which was added to the SNRA in calendar year 2015. A future iteration of the SNRA will assess the environmental impacts of this event.</p>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, studies over the past century have shown that meteorological drought is never the result of a single cause. It is the result of many causes, often synergistic in nature.</p>

<p>Scientists do not know how to predict drought a month or more in advance for most locations. Predicting drought depends on the ability to forecast two fundamental meteorological parameters, precipitation and temperature. Historical record reinforces that climate is inherently variable, and anomalies of precipitation and temperature may last from several months to several decades. How long they last depends on air-sea interactions, soil moisture and land surface processes, topography, internal dynamics, and the accumulated influence of dynamically unstable weather systems at the global scale. <a href="#droughtref24">[24]</a></p>

<h3>Additional Relevant Information</h3>

<p>Although a variety of weather related phenomena have the potential to cause great economic and personal losses in the US, drought has historically had the greatest impact on the largest number of people. On a broad scale, the 1980s and 1990s were characterized by unusual wetness with short periods of extensive droughts, the 1930s and 1950s were characterized by prolonged periods of extensive droughts with little wetness, and the first decade of the 2000s saw extensive drought and extensive wetness.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p id="droughtref1">1. There are no significant human health implications resulting from a drought in the United States. To avoid double counting of impacts between hazard events, for drought and heat wave incidents which overlapped in time or which were reported together in historical data sets the SNRA counted human fatalities and injuries under the Heat Wave event, while direct economic losses were counted under the Drought event. As both property damage (e.g., damage to physical infrastructure) and crop damage were reported by the primary data sources used for these events in the 2015 SNRA as combined totals, this raises the possibility of over-reporting the direct economic losses for Drought. Non-crop damages to physical infrastructure by heat events can be substantial. However, previous DHS analysis conducted for the 2013 Homeland Security National Risk Characterization (HSNRC) Drought National-level Event indicated that these property damage costs were generally insignificant in comparison to the economic value of lost crops which were orders of magnitude greater.</p>

<p id="droughtref2">2. Low, best, and high estimates for direct economic loss are the historical minimum, average, and maximum for the event set. Adjusted from 2014 dollars of NCDC source to 2011 dollars for comparison with existing SNRA events.</p>

<p id="droughtref3">3. See discussion.</p>

In 2012, NCDC reviewed its methodology how it develops Billion-dollar Disasters and examined possible inaccuracy and biases in the data sources and methodology used in developing the loss assessments. As a result, NCDC temporarily rounded their loss estimates to the nearest billion dollars while implementing the newest research to define uncertainty and confidence intervals surrounding these loss estimates. The current methodology for the production of this loss data set is described in <a href="#droughtref14">Smith et al (2013)</a>, op. cit. This document highlights its strengths and limitations including sources of uncertainty and bias. The Insurance Services Office/Property Claims Service, the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s crop insurance program are key sources of quantified disaster loss data, among others. The methodology uses a factor approach to convert from insured losses to total direct losses, one potential limitation.</p>

<p id="droughtref29">29. The 2012 drought is the most extensive drought to affect the U.S. since the 1930s. Moderate to extreme drought conditions affected more than half the country for a majority of 2012. Costly drought impacts occurred across the central agriculture states resulting in widespread harvest failure for corn, sorghum and soybean crops, among others. The associated summer heatwave also caused 123 direct deaths, but an estimate of the excess mortality due to heat stress is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Event Description and Analytical Methods</h3>

<p>For planning purposes, a national-level earthquake is defined as an earthquake producing direct economic loss in excess of $100 million dollars. The historical record of U.S. earthquakes during the 105-year time period from 1906 to 2011 was used estimate the interarrival rates/frequencies and impacts for earthquakes exceeding the $100 million threshold. To provide an accurate assessment for current year planning, historic damage estimates have been updated to estimate impacts for a 2011 base year. Economic and health & safety impacts, derived directly from historic record, are updated based on changes in populations, building structures, and infrastructure. In total, 27 earthquakes <a href="#eqf7">[7]</a> exceeding the $100 million threshold are aggregated in the findings of this report. The full list of national level earthquakes is located in Table 4.</p>

<p>Table 1 reports the maximum, average, and minimum frequency with which such earthquakes occurred in the United States, as well as the maximum, average, and minimum fatalities, injuries, and direct economic losses associated with earthquakes in the set. The oldest event included is the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the most recent is the 2003 Paso Robles/San Simeon earthquake.</p>

<p>To obtain impact estimates, normalized fatality and economic loss estimates for United States historic earthquakes reported by Vranes and Pielke (2009) were used.<a href="#eqf8">[8]</a> Normalization of impacts from historic record to present day values is performed by estimating changes in impact levels due to changes in population densities, community wealth, mitigation factors, and inflation. For most historic events, the present day community, with modern day structures and infrastructure, has a greater financial value than the community at the time of an event. Population densities have also changed. As the population increases, so too do the fatality and injury estimates for a given event. These increases, however, are offset, at least partially, by improving mitigation strategies. Improved building codes and emergency response substantially decrease the impacts caused by modern earthquakes. The impact estimates reported by Vranes and Pielke (2009) take into account the changes in mitigation strategies, population densities and wealth profiles when normalizing loss estimates to a 2005 base year. Because of the substantial changes in mitigation factors over the historical time period analyzed, a mitigation strategy was used in the normalization routine to relate loss rates to the year an event occurred. Three alternative mitigation rates were published by Vranes and Pielke (2009): no mitigation, a 1% per annum loss mitigation rate and a 2% per annum loss mitigation rate. The 2% mitigation rate was shown to have a lower correlation when compared to damage estimates normalized by magnitude and inflation <a href="#eqf9">[9]</a> than the 1% mitigation rate; therefore, the 1% mitigation rate was chosen as the best available impact normalization factor available for the purposes of this analysis. In other words, the normalized losses were reduced by 1% for each year since the event occurred. The CPI deflator was used to convert reported economic loss estimates from 2005 to 2011 dollars; for fatality estimates, the 2005 base year was maintained. For more detailed information on the normalization routine and raw event data used in this report, please refer to Vranes and Pielke (2009).</p>

<p>Normalized estimates were not available for injuries. To estimate injuries, a linear model was generated that relates normalized fatalities to injuries based on the ratio of injuries to fatalities for a New Madrid event as reported by Elnashai, et al. <a href="#eqf10">[10]</a> The linear model produces a multiplier that models the correlation between fatalities and injuries. Based on the New Madrid event estimates, a multiplier of 23.5 injuries per fatality was utilized in this report.</p>

<p>Low, best and high estimates were developed in the following manner from the normalized impact estimates and historic record. For fatalities, injuries and economic loss, the low estimate is the smallest impact for events that exceed $100 million. For economic loss, $107 million (1992 Ferndale/Fortuna/Petrolia, California earthquake) is the smallest normalized historic loss that exceeded $100 million. Six historic events exceeding the economic threshold did not result in any fatalities and, consequently, were not estimated to cause any injuries resulting in a minimum for both fatalities and injuries of zero. For event frequency, the low estimate is derived from the greatest time gap, tmax, between two events. The greatest gap occurs between the 1906 San Francisco and the 1915 El Centro earthquakes. This nine year time lapse between national level earthquakes results in an interarrival frequency of 0.11, or 1/tmax.</p>

<p>The best estimate is the average impact for events that exceed $100 million. The average economic impact is $8.7 billion per event. On average, 370 fatalities occur per event. An average of 8,700 injuries per event is using the multiplier technique described above. The average time between national level events is 3.7 years, resulting in 0.27 events expected per year. An estimate of the average annual loss for each impact type (e.g., fatalities per year or economic loss per year) can be obtained by multiplying the average frequency by the average impact in a category. The average annual fatality and economic losses for the set of 27 historic events analyzed are approximately 100 fatalities per year and approximately $2.3 billion per year. The average annual economic loss estimate computed using this subset of events is 50% less than FEMA’s average annual loss estimate of $5.3 billion for the full set of earthquake hazards, computed using HAZUS modeling. <a href="#eqf11">[11]</a>  More information about the FEMA average annual loss estimate is provided below.</p>

<p>The meanings of the high estimates for impact and frequency differ. For impacts, the high estimates reflect the largest losses seen within the set of national level event earthquakes, i.e., those above the $100 million economic loss threshold. The high fatality estimate, for example, is the normalized estimate for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake of approximately 9,000 fatalities if it were to happen in the present day; this is the highest normalized fatality estimate for the events included in the analysis. A high estimate of 210,000 injuries per event is using the multiplier technique described above. The high estimate for frequency is the maximum number of times an earthquake resulting in losses greater than $100 million has occurred in a calendar year, or 2 times per year.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the frequency estimates reported here differ from probabilities. The frequency of a national-level earthquake can be greater than one, while a probability cannot. Additionally, while the average estimates for impacts and frequency are correlated and approximate the average annual loss when multiplied together, the maximum and minimum historical values for impact and frequency are uncorrelated and do not have meaning when multiplied together.</p>

<h4>Expected Loss versus Return Period</h4>

<p>Major earthquakes are commonly evaluated based on return period and expected loss. The return period vs. loss is an important perspective when evaluating historic data. The 105-year range used for impacts in Table 1 does not provide a record of all possible impacts. Low frequency events have the capacity to eclipse the greatest damage reports from historic events. Earthquake modeling can be used to estimate losses for events with limited historical precedence in the modern era. Figure 1 relates modeled earthquake economic losses to the annual probability of exceedance. <a href="#eqf12">[12]</a> It is important to note that this is a modeled estimate, not actualized measured events.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement Estimates</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of 2 days or longer. Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as the significant differences between temporary evacuations and permanent displacement due to property destruction are not captured.</p>

<p>Social displacement estimates for national-level earthquakes were constructed from multiple data sources. The high estimate was provided by subject matter experts at FEMA and informed by experience with Hazus modeling as well as studies such as the analysis by Elnashai et al. (2009) of the number of people displaced from their homes and/or without electricity for greater than 3 days due to an earthquake in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. <a href="#eqf13">[13]</a> The order of magnitude of the SNRA high estimate for the number of people displaced from home for 2 days or greater was validated for this earthquake event by a subject matter expert affiliated with the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), who noted that “displacement in millions due to fires, damaged critical infrastructure, damaged residential areas” was plausible for the scenario of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake occurring on the San Andreas fault in the Los Angeles metropolitan area studied by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). <a href="#eqf14">[14]</a>  As a further validation point, note that displacement due to a 1906 San Francisco earthquake repeating itself in modern times were reported by Kircher et al. (2006) to be approximately 400,000-600,000 people due to damaged residences. <a href="#eqf15">[15]</a> The latter estimates are likely to underestimate the SNRA social displacement metric because the study did not account for the effects of fires or damage to transportation and utility systems on displacement.</p>

<p>Low and best estimates for social displacement were constructed in an ad-hoc manner by examining published reports of displacement in the recent U.S. historic earthquake record. The low estimate is the minimum of the social displacement estimates reported below, and the best estimate is the average value of the social displacement estimates reported below. This approach, while resulting in crude estimates, was chosen so that the low and best estimates were a reflection of the best available recent historic data. The low estimate reflects the observed occurrence of earthquakes which cause more than $100M in losses while having relatively minor impact on human populations. The best estimate begins to approach the same order of magnitude of social displacement as observed from the two most costly U.S. earthquakes of the past 40 years (the 1981 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake).</p>

<p>Note that the best estimate of social displacement is not necessarily correlated to the best estimate of frequency reported in Table 1. Also note that historic estimates reported in the table above are likely underestimates of social displacement as defined for the SNRA, because they are predominantly based upon permanent destruction of housing and may not include temporary displacement.</p>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on significant distress and prolonged distress, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs; a factor elicited from subject matter experts weights the index for differing psychological impact based on the type of event, but as a secondary input. <a href="#eqf21">[21]</a> The numerical outputs of this index formula were used to assign events to bins of a risk matrix for a semi-quantitative analysis of psychological risk in the SNRA.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impacts</h4>

<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. Estimates are based on the following assumptions:

<ul><li>Experts were elicited to provide estimates in the environmental impact category based on assumptions. Actual environmental/ecological harm that occurs as a result of the events described in a given scenario may vary considerably, and will depend on numerous variables (e.g., chemical or biological agent, contamination extent, persistence, toxicity—both chronic and acute toxicity—and infectivity).</li>

<li>EPA defined environmental consequence (impact) <a href="#eqf22">[22]</a> as the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, or accidental chemical releases; energy use; or the depletion of natural resources.</li>

<li>Experts identified the best estimate for environmental impacts as “moderate.” Debris, devastation, and chemical or contaminant releases from damaged facilities have the potential to impact large areas.</li></ul></p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p class="small">The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate health and safety impacts caused by an earthquake event:

<ul class="small"><li>Earthquake mitigation has improved by 1% annually.</li>

<li>A linear multiplier of fatalities is sufficient for estimating the injuries associated with earthquakes to the desired precision of the SNRA (i.e., within an order of magnitude).</li></ul></p>

<p class="small">The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate direct economic impacts caused by an earthquake event:

<ul class="small"><li>Indirect losses included in historic records do not significantly bias direct economic loss estimates.</li>

<li>Correcting for inflation only from 2005-2011 does not significantly bias direct economic estimates. (Published normalized economic losses incorporating population, wealth, and mitigating factors were only available through 2005.)</li></ul></p>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>The following key factors can mitigate the potential impacts caused by earthquakes: population and wealth/assets density, land use, construction type and quality, adherence to building codes in design, level of preparedness and awareness in dealing with disasters, and the potential/extent for liquefaction.</p>

</figure>

<h3>Additional Relevant Information</h3>
  
<p>Figure 2 shows, from a national perspective, the probability that ground motion would reach a certain level during an earthquake. The data show peak horizontal ground acceleration (the fastest measured change in speed for a particle at ground level that is moving horizontally due to an earthquake) with a 10 percent probability of exceedance in 50 years. The map was compiled by the USGS Geologic Hazards Team.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 2, the areas with the highest probability of seismic impacts in the U.S. are in western California, with moderate probability across larger areas of the western U.S., the Midwest, and around Charleston, SC.</p>

<p>In 2008, FEMA estimated average annualized losses from earthquakes for the entire nation by state. The estimated average annualized loss (AAL) addresses risk by estimating the probability of loss occurring in the study area (largely a function of building construction type and quality). By annualizing estimated losses, the AAL factors in historic patterns of frequent, smaller events with infrequent but larger events to provide a balanced presentation of risk. The AAL analysis yielded an estimate of the national AAL of $5.3 billion per year. This estimate does not include lifeline infrastructure losses or indirect (long-term) economic losses, and is therefore, a minimum estimate of the potential losses. Moreover, the estimate represents a long-term average and actual losses in any single year may be much larger or smaller.</p>

<p>The annualized loss ratio (ALR) represents the AAL as a fraction of the replacement value of the local inventory. The ALR gauges the relationship between average AAL and replacement value. This ratio can be used as a measure of vulnerability in the areas and, because it is normalized by replacement value, it can be directly compared across different geographic units such as metropolitan areas or counties.</p>

<p>Figure 3 depicts the resulting state ALRs from this study, which helps to illustrate a national perspective of those areas more vulnerable to potential earthquake impacts. The states shown in dark red (Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Utah) have the highest expected ALRs among all states and therefore have a higher likelihood of experiencing earthquake losses in any given year. Florida, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan have the lowest ALRs and are therefore least likely to experience earthquake losses when compared with the rest of the nation</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows the annualized earthquake losses (AEL) by metropolitan area. Table 3 shows the top 7 metropolitan areas vulnerable to earthquake losses, as ranked using AEL. Of these 7 vulnerable areas, 5 are located in California.</p>

<p id="eqf4">4.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. The comments and rankings presented in this Risk Summary Sheet have not undergone review by the EPA and only represent the opinions of the group. Estimates pertain to the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment; they are grouped into high, moderate, low, and de minimus (none) categories. Experts provided both first and second choice categories, allowing the experts to express  uncertainty in their judgments as well as reflect the range of potential effects that might result depending on the specifics of the event. The first choice represents the ‘best’ estimate.</p>

Accessed on September 28, 2011. The number of “total affected” includes injuries, people needing immediate assistance for shelter, and people needing immediate assistance, including displacements and evacuations.

The Significant Distress Index is calculated from these inputs using a formula proposed by subject matter experts consulted for the SNRA project: <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> × (5 <i>Fat</i> + <i>Inj</i> + ½ <i>D</i>), where <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> represents the number of persons significantly distressed, <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> is the expert assessed Event Familiarity Factor, <i>Fat</i> is the number of fatalities, <i>Inj</i> is the number of injuries and/or illnesses, and <i>D</i> is the number of persons displaced (Social Displacement). In words, this formula suggests that there are 5 significantly distressed persons for each life lost; 1 for each person injured; and 1 for each 2 people displaced. This formula was constructed to reflect the empirical finding that the most severe stressor of a disaster is losing a loved one, followed by injury, followed by displacement. Uncertainty was captured by applying the index formula to the low, best, and high estimates of these three human impact metrics.</p>

<p>The Event Familiarity Factor is intended to capture the extent to which the event entails an ongoing threat with uncertainty regarding long term effects, is unfamiliar, or that people dread, exacerbating psychological impacts. This factor, ranging from 1.0 for familiar events to 1.3 for unfamiliar events, was provided by subject matter experts for each national-level event included in the SNRA: earthquakes were given a <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> of 1.1.</p>

<p>The numerical estimates calculated from this formula are reported in Appendix G. The semi-quantitative risk matrix is discussed in the Findings (Psychological Distress Risk).</p>

<p id="eqf22">22.  The 2011 SNRA referred to impacts as ‘consequences’ because of prior usage in quantitative risk assessment (Kaplan and Garrick [1981, March], On the quantitative definition of risk: <i>Risk Analysis</i> 1(1) 11-32). Except where it will cause confusion, ‘impact’ is used synonymously in this document because of pre-existing connotations of the word ‘consequence’ within FEMA.</p>

<h2>Migrant Surge / Mass Migration</h2>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>

<p>This survey of recent mass migration surge events and a review of associated research literature indicate there is a strong likelihood of future surges to the U.S. Such surges are caused by complex structural factors that render ‘quick solutions’ unlikely. This paper provides an overview of the “Why,” “Who,” and “How” of migration, including the dangers migrants encounter in their journey, an overview of the recent history of migration, examples of recent surges, and a brief overview of the roles and responsibilities of various U.S. Government agencies related to mass migration.</p>

<p>The literature review is grouped into two themes: (1) the 2014 Central American surge of unaccompanied children, and (2) push factors are intensifying and are likely to increase the frequency of surges.</p>

<h3>Literature Review – Risk of Mass Migration Likely Increasing</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<h5>Event Description</h5>

<p>Mass Migration is defined as a concentrated flow, or surge, of migrants into the United States primarily along maritime and land borders, regardless of method of entry or reason for migrating.<a href="#mm1">[1]</a> This assessment is inclusive of both legal and illegal (undocumented) migration attempts. It is focused on the short-term impacts to the United States in handling a surge of migrants, that is, primarily the increased resources and capabilities needed to manage a surge.<a href="#mm2">[2]</a> It does not attempt to assess the long-term impacts of legal or illegal immigration. This assessment also does not consider repatriation efforts even in events where repatriation and mass migration may be comingled concerns.</p>

<h5>Event Background</h5>

<h6>Why People Migrate</h6>

<p>Marc Rosenblum<a href="#mm3">[3]</a> and Kate Brick’s 2011 study, U.S. Immigration Policy and Mexican/Central American Migration Flows: Then and Now, explains “why people move, who and how many people migrate, and how they choose where to go, depends on a combination of structural factors that are difficult for governments to control and on the policy environment in which migration decision making occurs.”<a href="#mm4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The reasons can be categorized into three structural factors:<a href="#mm5">[5]</a></p>

<ul><li>Push Factors – Factors in the country of origin that encourage departure. These can include limited economic opportunity, authoritarian or corrupt governments, crime, lack of education, wars, and natural disasters.</li>

<li>Pull Factors – Factors that attract migrants to a country include availability of jobs and associated economic opportunities for immigrants and families, including safety, limited government, and equality before the law.</li>

<li>Social networks – The ability to connect migrants to host-state jobs and communities. This occurs through providing funds and information to would-be migrants, assisting with how to relate to public authorities, and integration into the host-state economy. Rosenblum and Brick point out that with 10-20 percent of Mexicans and Central Americans now living in the U.S., social networks are a particularly important factor within this region.</li></ul>

<h6>The Current “Wave” of Immigration to the United States</h6>

<p>Historically speaking, we are presently in the fourth ‘great wave’ of immigration. Figure 1 shows that the current immigrant<a href="#mm6">[6]</a> share of the U.S. population, 13.1 percent in 2013, is similar to that of the period of 1860-1920.<a href="#mm7">[7]</a>,<a href="#mm8">[8]</a> Historians consider that period to include the second and third waves of large-scale immigration. The fourth peak period began in the 1970s and continues today.<a href="#mm9">[9]</a>, <a href="#mm10">[10]</a>, <a href="#mm11">[11]</a></p>

<figcaption>Figure 1: Migration Policy Institute (MPI) - Number of Immigrants and Percentage of the Total U.S. Population, 1850-2013</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In 2007, there was a decline in both legal and illegal immigration, which coincides with the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Figure 2 shows the number of people granted legal permanent residency each year and the decline that began around 2007.<a href="#mm12">[12]</a></p>

</figure>

<p>Figure 3 shows the number of illegal immigrants estimated to be in the United States with a slight decline and leveling off around 2007.<a href="#mm13">[13]</a>, <a href="#mm14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Hipsman and Meissner assert “illegal immigration is a bellwether of economic conditions, growing substantially in a strong economy with high demand for low-skilled labor (the 1990s and early 2000s), and tapering off with economic contraction (since 2008).” The decline may also be due to “heightened border enforcement, a rise in deportations, and the growing dangers associated with illegal border crossings.”<a href="#mm15">[15]</a> As of March 2015, most research reflects data as late as 2013, and the researchers acknowledge it is possible, even likely, that the immigration numbers will increase again as the U.S. economy recovers.</p>

<h6>U.S. Immigrants’ Countries of Origin</h6>

<p>After the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965, there was a remarkable shift of migratory patterns.</p>

<p>Prior to 1960, the U.S. immigrant population consisted mostly of European immigrants settling in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. Beginning in 1970s, it was predominantly Latin American and Asian immigrants settling in the U.S. South and West.<a href="#mm16">[16]</a>,<a href="#mm17">[17]</a></p>

<p>In the 1970s there was a sharp rise in the number of Mexican-born immigrants arriving in the U.S. and by 1980, Mexico became the top originating country for U.S. immigrants.<a href="#mm18">[18]</a> In 2013, they accounted for 28 percent of the 41.3 million immigrants in the United States,<a href="#mm19">[19]</a> and they accounted for the largest share of both legal and illegal entries.<a href="#mm20">[20]</a> A Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends study conducted by Jeffrey Passel, D’Vera Cohn, and Ana Gonzalez-Barrera points out that in the history of the U.S., “no country has ever seen as many of its people immigrate to this country as Mexico has in the past four decades.”<a href="#mm21">[21]</a>,<a href="#mm22">[22]</a> Further, the most “distinctive feature” of this wave is the “unprecedented share” (51 percent) of immigrants who have come to the U.S. illegally.<a href="#mm23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Now after four decades of Mexico leading as the dominant country of migration origin, we may be seeing another significant shift. In 2012, the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends project examined census data from the U.S. and Mexico and found that immigration flows from Mexico have declined significantly, and simultaneously that the number of Mexican-born immigrants who left the U.S. for Mexico rose. They asserted that the result is a net migration flow of zero.<a href="#mm24">[24]</a></p>

<p>Further, in a November 2014 report, the Pew Research Center identified that “as Mexican numbers continued to drop between 2009 and 2012, unauthorized immigrant populations from South America and from a grouping of Europe and Canada held steady,” and, migrants from “Asia, the Caribbean, Central America,<a href="#mm25">[25]</a> and the rest of the world grew slightly from 2009 to 2012”.<a href="#mm26">[26]</a></p>

<p>In October 2011, the U.S. Government began seeing a dramatic rise in the number of unaccompanied<a href="#mm27">[27]</a>  and separated children from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.<a href="#mm28">[28]</a> Experts believe the surge is related to push factors that have intensified in recent years, including some of the highest homicide rates in the world, increasing crime and violence due to gangs, drug trafficking and organized crime, extreme poverty, and government corruption.<a href="#mm29">[29]</a> In the spring of 2014, a migration surge of unaccompanied minors captured the attention of the American public. This phenomenon is explored in the Literature Review section below, but it is worthwhile to point out that the increase of Central American migrants –adults, family units, and unaccompanied minors – was identified by Border Patrol statistics and recognized by researchers several years prior to 2014.</p>

<p>Figure 4 shows the percentages of the top ten originating countries as of 2013. After Mexico, the top countries of origin are: India, China (including Hong Kong but not Taiwan), Philippines, Vietnam, El Salvador, Cuba, Korea, Dominican Republic and Guatemala.<a href="#mm30">[30]</a></p>

<h6>Examples of Migrant Surges</h6>

<p>Along the land border, some would argue the past four decades of Mexican migration have been an ever-growing ‘surge’ until the decline and leveling-off beginning in 2007. Most of the ebbs and flows of migration on the southern land border have primarily been related to the economic cycles in both Mexico and the U.S. The recent surge of unaccompanied minors will be discussed in the Literature Review.</p>

<p>Along the Southeast maritime border, Haiti and Cuba historically and currently meet the push factors criteria described above and pose a risk for mass migration into the United States.<a href="#mm31">[31]</a> Both countries are geographically near to the U.S. and have had an ongoing flow of undocumented migrants into the U.S. for years.</p>

<ul><li>Between 1991 and 1995 over 120,000 migrants from 23 countries were interdicted. Haitian migrants began increased departures after a 1991 coup in Haiti.</li>

<li>In 1994, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) responded to three mass migrations almost simultaneously—first from Haiti, then from Cuba, and again from Haiti—rescuing and preventing over 63,000 migrants attempting to illegally entering the U.S.</li>

<li>The Dominican Republic has historically been a major source country for undocumented migrants attempting to enter the U.S. crossing the Mona Passage (the body of water between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico) to enter Puerto Rico. Thousands of people have taken to sea in a variety of vessels, the most common is a homemade fishing vessel known as a Yola. Most of these migrants are smuggled by highly organized gangs. From April 1, 1995 through October 1, 1997, USCG conducted Operation ABLE RESPONSE, with enhanced operations dedicated to interdicting Dominican migrants. Over 9,500 migrants were interdicted or turned back when they sighted a USCG asset.</li>

<p><li>Haiti suffered a devastating earthquake on January 12, 2010. Its effects caused roughly 2 million people to become displaced, 3.5 million people requiring humanitarian aid, and $7.8 billion in damages and losses—a figure that was 120 percent of Haiti’s gross domestic product. Due to the lack of in-country resources, the stress on traditional United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) response capabilities, political instability, and the desire to reduce the risk of mass migration to the U.S., the U.S., in coordination with UN OCHA and USAID OFDA, deployed 20,000 civilian and military personnel and provided $1 billion in humanitarian funding in part in order to prevent a mass migration into the U.S. In addition to the unstable environmental conditions, issues such as general lawlessness and disease outbreaks continue to prevail. These health, safety, and security factors can trigger a mass exodus to nearby nations, including the U.S.</li>

<p><li>In January 2015, the USCG announced<a href="#mm32">[32]</a> there had been a surge of attempted maritime entries by Cubans. (Customs and Border Protection announced a similar surge at land border crossings and airports). The December 2014 announcement that the U.S. and Cuba were seeking to normalize relations spurred rumors and fears that the long-standing Cuban immigration policy, known as “wet foot/dry foot,” may change. This misperception prompted an increase of Cubans attempting entry into the U.S. before any changes in policy could occur.<a href="#mm33">[33]</a>,<a href="#mm34">[34]</a></li></ul>

<h6>The Dangerous Journey</h6>

<p>Migrants often take great risks and endure significant hardships in their attempts to flee their countries and enter the United States. Individuals attempting to gain unauthorized entry into the U.S experience the vast majority of these dangers.</p>

<p>Of the asylum-seeking and unauthorized entries, the United Nations (UN) estimated that 97 percent enter the U.S. clandestinely through the border with Mexico, and maritime interdictions account for only one percent of the total.<a href="#mm35">[35]</a>,<a href="#mm36">[36]</a> The increased U.S. border enforcement since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as the increased violence and dangers in the route to the border, appears to have deterred independent border crossers.<a href="#mm37">[37]</a> Increasingly, migrants employ smugglers to help them with the journey.<a href="#mm38">[38]</a> Crossing the border is often done in trucks, sometimes on foot, and there have been cases in which the crossing is made by rail, or even through special tunnels.<a href="#mm39">[39]</a> Air travel using fraudulent visas is the preferred route for those who can afford it.<a href="#mm40">[40]</a></p>

<p>The sophistication of the smugglers range from that of individual and family-run operations to organized criminal groups. For the smugglers, there appears to be little risk of arrest—if they are caught, they often pretend to be migrants themselves and are repatriated rather than apprehended. In 2010, the estimated amount paid to smugglers per migrant varied from $2,000-3,000<a href="#mm41">[41]</a> for a Mexican-born migrant to $10,000 for non-Mexican-born.<a href="#mm42">[42]</a> The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates smuggling into the U.S. is a $6.6 billion a year business.<a href="#mm43">[43]</a> Organized crime syndicates that previously focused on narcotics and contraband flows have been attracted by the higher fees and now incorporate humans into their smuggling networks.<a href="#mm44">[44]</a></p>

<p>The dangers of the journey to unauthorized entry are multi-faceted and somewhat depend on the route and method of crossing:</p>

<ul><li>Maritime – Travel by sea is precarious as migrant vessels are often nothing more than homemade rafts or boats. They are usually overloaded and unseaworthy, lack basic safety equipment, and are operated by inexperienced mariners. Most of the U.S. Coast Guard’s interdictions begin as search and rescue missions.<a href="#mm45">[45]</a> Alternatively, smugglers often use fast boats to avoid interdiction; however, employing smugglers comes with its own risks (see below).</li>

<li>La Bestia – As many as half a million Central American migrants annually board freight trains colloquially known as “La Bestia,” or the beast, on their journey to the United States. The cargo trains, which run along multiple lines, carry products north for export. As there are no passenger railcars, migrants must ride atop the moving trains, facing physical dangers that range from amputation to death if they fall or are pushed. Accidents caused by train derailments and falls because of changes in speed or migrants falling asleep are common.<a href="#mm46">[46]</a> Migrants get off the train prior to reaching the U.S. border and usually cross on foot. The Mexican Government does not have a comprehensive policy to address the La Bestia phenomena and responses of various Mexican authorities have been “disjointed, uncoordinated, and often in reaction to particular events widely covered in the news.”<a href="#mm47">[47]</a></li>

<li>Lack of Protection from Governmental Authorities – As migrants journey to their destination, they often transit through other countries, the most prominent example being Mexico. In the past, the governments of those countries turn a blind eye to the migrants transiting illegally through their territory because they know they do not intend to stay in their country. Due to increased U.S. pressure to disrupt the flow of migrants, the Mexican Government has made efforts to “implement new security and surveillance measures with U.S. assistance” along the southern border of Mexico.<a href="#mm48">[48]</a> The challenge is that by increasing enforcement, migrants that are victims of crime at the hands of cartels, gangs and organized crime are less likely to report such crime for fear of deportation. Further, “reputable non- governmental organizations including Amnesty International, Sin Fronteras, and Catholic Relief Services, have documented” cases of abuse of power by Mexican authorities.<a href="#mm49">[49]</a> The Migration Policy Institute asserts that the Mexican Government’s response demonstrates “the struggle to simultaneously develop policies that tackle border enforcement, increased security, and the protection of human rights.”<a href="#mm50">[50]</a></li></ul>

<li>Drug Cartels, Gangs and Organized Crime – On the journey from their home country to the U.S. border, migrants are often subject to extortion, kidnapping, violence, sexual assault, serious injury, or death at the hands gangs and organized-crime groups that control the routes into the U.S.<a href="#mm51">[51]</a>,<a href="#mm52">[52]</a> The National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), an autonomous institution funded by the Mexican government, reported more than 11,000 abductions of migrants between April and September 2010.<a href="#mm53">[53]</a></li>

<li>Smugglers – As described above, increasingly, migrants employ smugglers that promise to get them across the borders and help them navigate the dangers of the wilderness. After they receive payment, smugglers have been known to rob, rape, and even kill their “customers.” They also often hold the migrants hostage until final payment is received, usually by the migrants’ relatives in the country of origin or the U.S.<a href="#mm54">[54]</a></li>

<li>Wilderness – Once across the border, migrants must endure long hikes in stretches of desert. In an effort to avoid apprehension by the U.S. Border Patrol, the routes used are difficult and treacherous. The heat, snakes and wild animals, and a lack of water can lead to injuries, dehydration, heat stroke, and death.<a href="#mm55">[55]</a>,<a href="#mm56">[56]</a> For fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Border Patrol conducted 1,457 rescues and reported 307 known deaths in the Southwest border sectors.<a href="#mm57">[57]</a></li></ul>

<h5>U.S. Government Roles and Missions Related to Mass Migration</h5>

<p>The U.S. Government’s response to mass migration is multifaceted. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the primary responsibility to secure and manage the U.S. borders. Responsibility for the enforcement of immigration law within DHS rests with USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>

<p>USCG,<a href="#mm58">[58]</a> as the United States’ primary maritime law enforcement agency and tasked with enforcing immigration law at sea, is the lead organization in the DHS for intercepting migrants at sea. The USCG conducts patrols and coordinates with other Federal agencies and foreign countries to interdict undocumented migrants at sea, if appropriate, denying them entry via maritime routes to the United States, its territories, and possessions.</p>

<p>CBP is generally responsible for immigration enforcement at and between the ports of entry, focusing on preventing drugs, weapons, terrorists and other inadmissible persons from entering the country. The CBP’s Office of Air and Marine (OAM) also has a maritime law enforcement mission to detect, interdict, and prevent acts of terrorism and the unlawful movement of people, illegal drugs, and other contraband toward or across U.S. borders. OAM is the world’s largest aviation and maritime law enforcement organization, and is a critical component of CBP’s layered enforcement strategy for border security.<a href="#mm59">[59]</a></p>

<p>In general, OAM's law enforcement authorities extend to the U.S. customs waters and land/riverine border environments, while the USCG’s law enforcement authorities extend from U.S. waterways and marinas outward into international waters. Both operate marine and air assets. Unlike OAM, the USCG can use its Title 10 authority to operate as a member of the armed services under military chain of command.</p>

<p>ICE is generally responsible for interior enforcement, including detention and removal operations. USCIS is generally responsible for the administration of immigration and naturalization functions.<a href="#mm60">[60]</a></p>

<p>Outside of DHS, other Federal agencies with missions related to immigration are affected by a surge:</p>

<ul><li>The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), U.S. Department of Justice adjudicates immigration cases and seeks to fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpret and administer the Nation’s immigration laws. Under delegated authority from the Attorney General, EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings.<a href="#mm61">[61]</a></li>

<li>The Department of State’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration’s (PRM)<a href="#mm62">[62]</a> mission is to provide protection, ease suffering, and resolve the plight of persecuted and uprooted people around the world on behalf of the American people by providing life- sustaining assistance, working through multilateral systems to build global partnerships, promoting best practices in humanitarian response, and ensuring that humanitarian principles are thoroughly integrated into U.S. foreign and national security policy. PRM administers the refugee admissions program; it works in partnership with USCIS to review refugee and asylum applications.</li>

<li>The Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)<a href="#mm63">[63]</a> provides refugees the social services they need to become self-sufficient as quickly as possible after their arrival in the U.S. ORR provides benefits and services to assist the resettlement and local integration of specific eligible populations, including refugees; asylees; Cuban/Haitian Entrants; Certified Victims of Trafficking; Iraqi or Afghan Special Immigrants; Amerasians; Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) who have held one of those statuses in the past, and in most cases, spouses and unmarried children under 21 of those holding such statuses. The ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children Program provides temporary custody and care to unaccompanied alien children who do not have an immigration status.<a href="#mm64">[64]</a></li></ul>

<h5>U.S. Protection and Response-Related Mass Migration Costs</h5>

<p>There is limited knowledge on the immediate response-related<a href="#mm65">[65]</a>,< costs of mass migration to the host country.</p>

<p>The USCG’s National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment (NMSRA) assessed the economic impact per illegal migrant entry via maritime routes to be $33,000. This is an average value over multiple scenarios varying in magnitude and character, and was developed for the purpose of calculating equivalencies across disparate consequences to inform USCG risk assessments for the purpose of long-range strategic planning and long-term capability investment decisions.<a href="#mm66">[66]</a></p>

<p>In July 2014, the President requested $3.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding to address the surge of children arriving from Central America countries.<a href="#mm67">[67]</a>,<a href="#mm68">[68]</a> The request<a href="#mm69">[69]</a> included funding for:</p>

<ul><li>DHS’s ICE and CBP to handle increased protective, investigatory, and enforcement costs, as well as transportation and processing costs for the children,</li>

<li>DOJ’s EOIR for hiring more immigration judge teams in order to expedite case processing and legal representation for the children,</li>

<li>HHS’s ACF/ORR for additional capacity to provide temporary care and custody for unaccompanied children in the least restrictive setting while awaiting their immigration court date, and</li>

<li>Department of State for repatriation and reintegration of migrants to their home countries and for public diplomacy and international information programs.</li></ul>

<p>DHS’s 2016 budget request included increased resources for a comprehensive “Southern Border & Approaches Campaign.” The request includes funds for:</p>

<ul><li>The costs associated with apprehension and care of up to 104,000 unaccompanied children. A portion of these funds will be used to prepare facilities for families and unaccompanied children in the event of a surge that exceeds prior year apprehension levels. The request proposes up to $162 million in contingency obligation authority—enabling CBP and ICE to respond effectively in the event migration volume significantly surpasses prior-year levels.<a href="#mm70">[70]</a></li></ul>

<p>Literature was not found that consolidates and assesses spending requests and actual spending over multiple fiscal years across Federal agencies.</p>

<h4>Literature Review Theme 1 - The Central American “Surge” of Unaccompanied Children</h4>

<p>In the spring of 2014, the American public was shocked to learn of the flood of unaccompanied minors at the southwest border. This trend began well before that spring however. The total number of CBP apprehensions of unaccompanied and separated children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala—collectively known as the Northern Triangle—had doubled each year from FY 2011 to FY 2014<a href="#mm71">[71]</a>,<, reaching a peak of nearly 52,000 children. (When children from Mexico are included, the number reaches over 67,000.) Early indications are that the migration flows may not be as intense as last year, as of March 31, 2015, the FY 2015 statistics show a 45 percent decline when compared to the same time period in FY 2014.<a href="#mm72">[72]</a> However, the rate of migration is still on pace to be at least as high as FY 2012 or 2013. A survey of literature from the past five years on the broad topic of migration to the U.S. found a significant majority of the literature focused on this topic.</p>

<p>In 2014, the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released a study entitled “Children on the Run: Unaccompanied Children Leaving Central America and Mexico and the Need for International Protection.”<a href="#mm73">[73]</a> Beginning in 2009, UNHCR, the UN agency responsible for receiving asylum requests, began receiving an increased number from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.<a href="#mm74">[74]</a> From 2008 – 2013, there was a 712 percent increase in asylum requests from these three countries.<a href="#mm75">[75]</a>,<a href="#mm76">[76]</a> The study was based on in-depth, individual interviews conducted between May and August 2013, with Northern Triangle and Mexican children that began arriving after the October 2011 surge began. Nearly all of the children were interviewed while in the custody of the HHS’s ACF/ORR. The report includes compelling narratives collected from the children describing the dangers and hardships from their homeland. It is primarily focused on the causes for attempting entry into the U.S. It does not collect information on the migration journey to the U.S.</p>

<p>Unique to the UNHCR report is a suggestion that there may also be a crisis with Mexican-born unaccompanied minors. Though the increase from the Northern Triangle is more dramatic, the migration of unaccompanied minors from Mexico has occurred over a longer period of time and outpaced the number of children migrating from any one of the Northern Triangle countries until FY 2014. The policy for Mexican-born persons is different than that for other migrants, and they are usually returned to Mexico within a day or two of apprehension. As a result, it was difficult for researchers to determine who the children were and why they were coming to the U.S.<a href="#mm77">[77]</a></p>

<p>The UNHCR report found that 58 percent of children arriving from the Northern Triangle and Mexico raise potential international protection<a href="#mm78">[78]</a> needs.<a href="#mm79">[79]</a> The primary cause, at 48 percent, was violence by organized armed criminal actors, including drug cartels and gangs or by state actors.<a href="#mm80">[80]</a> The report examines the findings for each country of origin. El Salvador appears to be the most volatile; 72 percent of the migrant children cases raised potential international protection needs.<a href="#mm81">[81]</a>,<a href="#mm82">[82]</a></p>

<p>The study demonstrates that the push factors involved in causing the displacement are complex. Notably, most of its recommendations are focused on what the international community, as well as the receiving countries, should do to address not only the emerging displacement of children from Central America, but also the unique needs the children require in the international protection process. It is a quiet acknowledgement that the international community’s ability to fix the violence push factor is limited.</p>

<p>The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a Report based on a delegation sent to Central America in November 2013.<a href="#mm83">[83]</a> Consistent with the UNHCR Report, they found that “violence and criminal actors have permeated all aspects of life in Central America and are the primary factors driving the migration of children from the region.” They also noted that other “push factors include the absence of economic opportunity, the lack of quality education and access to education generally, and the resulting inability for individuals to financially support themselves and their families in their home countries/local communities; and the desire to reunify with family in the United States.”<a href="#mm84">[84]</a>,<a href="#mm85">[85]</a>,<a href="#mm86">[86]</a></p>

<p>These in-depth studies indicated children were encouraged by their family members to flee to the U.S. as a way to escape the violence at home. The UNHCR study was limited to a child’s perspective on why they were told to leave home. A limit of the study was the inability to ask the child’s parents or guardians why they felt that the journey to the U.S. was a more suitable risk than the risk of staying in their home country. Certainly there is a potential that the explanation a parent gives to a child is simplified.</p>

<p>Other potential causes for the surge include the following:</p>

<ul><li>Attempting to take advantage of how the U.S. immigration process works, particularly for unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries (countries other than Mexico and Canada):</li>

<li>Non-Mexican and non-Canadian children have a lengthier screening process: New provisions added to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) in 2008, require that all unaccompanied alien children be screened as potential victims of human trafficking. While children from non-contiguous countries are transferred to HHS for trafficking screening, and placed into formal immigration court removal proceedings, Mexican and Canadian children are screened by CBP for trafficking and, if no signs are reported, returned pursuant to negotiated repatriation agreements. The TVPRA in 2008 also ensured that unaccompanied alien children are exempt from certain limitations on asylum (i.e. a one-year filing deadline, and the standard safe third country limitation).<a href="#mm87">[87]</a></li>

<li>The process prioritizes and facilitates reunification with the child’s parent or other family members in the U.S., even if they are in the U.S. illegally: The TVPRA directs that unaccompanied children must “be promptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.”<a href="#mm88">[88]</a> Further, the settlement agreement in Flores v. Reno, which is binding on the U.S. Government, establishes an order of priority for sponsors with whom children should be placed, except in limited circumstances. The first preference for placement would be with a parent of the child. If a parent is not available, the preference is for placement with the child’s legal guardian, and then to various adult family members.<a href="#mm89">[89]</a></li>

<li>A misunderstanding exists about the U.S. immigration process particularly for unaccompanied children and those seeking asylum.<a href="#mm90">[90]</a>,<a href="#mm91">[91]</a> There are accounts of smugglers and organized crime perpetuating misinformation about the process.<a href="#mm92">[92]</a>,<a href="#mm93">[93]</a> One rumor is the belief that U.S. Immigration laws grant permisos (free passes) to unaccompanied children. Another potential source of misinformation is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a 2012 executive order that allowed some undocumented individuals who previously arrived to the U.S. to remain in the U.S. legally. While the order applied only to children arriving prior to 2007, one theory is that the rumors and misinformation may have encouraged the child-migrant wave.</li>

<li>A stronger, more sophisticated smuggling infrastructure and network.<a href="#mm94">[94]</a>,<a href="#mm95">[95]</a></li></ul>

<p>There is no shortage of studies and perspectives on the surge of Central American unaccompanied minors. Multiple Washington, DC based think tanks have issued reports<a href="#mm96">[96]</a>,<a href="#mm97">[97]</a>,<a href="#mm98">[98]</a> and there have been numerous Congressional hearings<a href="#mm33">[99]</a>,<a href="#mm100">[100]</a>,<a href="#mm101">[101]</a>,<a href="#mm102">[102]</a> and GAO and CRS Reports<a href="#mm103">[103]</a>,<a href="#mm104">[104]</a> to examine both the causes of as well as the actions taken to address the surge.</p>

<p>The President declared it a humanitarian crisis and some called it a threat to national security because of the drain on CBP resources (focusing on the unaccompanied children and family units left little room for addressing other potential threats).<a href="#mm105">[105]</a> The response by the U.S. Government to the 2014 surge was unprecedented and leveraged capabilities usually reserved for disaster declarations. The President directed the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to lead a Government-wide response to the situation, which included the following activities:<a href="#mm106">[106]</a></p>

<ul><li>Diplomatic engagement with Central America and Mexico and providing new financial support to address the root push factors;</li>

<li>Increased enforcement mechanisms to more quickly conduct removal proceedings for those not eligible for asylum—in the hopes that expedited returns will decrease some of the pull factors;</li>

<li>Communication campaigns to combat rumors that may have been contributing to the pull factors (e.g., DACA eligibility and permisos); and</li>

<li>Expanding capacity in the HHS/ACF/ORR nationwide shelter network and standing up temporary shelters on Department of Defense sites staffed by trained ORR grantee staff.</li></ul>

<p>There are early hopes that these efforts appear to have worked. By March 2015, CBP reported a 45 percent decline in the number of unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle and Mexico. However most experts have indicated that the complicated confluence of pull and push factors will not be fully resolved in the short term.<a href="#mm107">[107]</a>,<a href="#mm108">[108]</a>,<a href="#mm109">[109]</a></p>

<p>A Brookings Institution assessment suggests that the surge from Central America may be a reaction by criminal organizations to the Mexican Government’s crackdown on them (i.e., they are seeking “alternative profitable ventures”).<a href="#mm110">[110]</a> Similar to successful legal businesses, criminal organizations adapt to their environment. Thus, to the extent the drivers of the surge are the smugglers and other organized criminals, we should expect that as U.S. policy changes, so too will the behavior of these organizations.</p>

<p>Some suggest that we are already seeing examples of such adaptability. Papedemetriou and Hooper of the Migration Policy Institute assert that though the U.S. and other European countries have strengthened and take seriously their border security, the system is continually tested by “increasingly creative entry strategies.”<a href="#mm111">[111]</a> A relatively new trend is for migrants to make no effort to avoid border patrol; instead they would actually present themselves for apprehension and processing. While some migrants do this because they believe they have a legitimate request for asylum, other migrants without such claims believe that the system will take so long to process them that they will be allowed to stay for at least several years. Because the migration flow is “mixed”—inclusive of asylum seekers as well as economic and family-stream migrants— it is harder for authorities to process and discern which migrants have legitimate claims for asylum. For such a trend to occur, the smugglers must be advising their ‘clients’ that this is the best approach given the current strength of border security.</p>

<h4>Literature Review Theme 2 – Push Factors are Intensifying and are Likely to Increase the Frequency of Surges</h4>

<h5>Conflict-Related Push Factors</h5>

<p>The number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people (collectively, forced displacement) worldwide exceeded 50 million people in 2014 – the highest level since the post- World War II era – according to the UNHCR’s Global Trends Report for 2013.<a href="#mm112">[112]</a> Half of forcibly displaced people are children, the highest figure in a decade.<a href="#mm113">[113]</a> The war in Syria is the main cause of the massive increase: at the end of 2013, the conflict had led to 2.5 million refugees and rendered 6.5 million internally displaced.<a href="#mm114">[114]</a> In November 2014, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees called it a “mega-crisis”.<a href="#mm115">[115]</a> The Migration Policy Institute (MPI) extrapolates that the numbers for 2014 will show an even greater increase due to the rise of the jihadist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the ensuing sectarian violence that forced many Iraqis to flee.<a href="#mm116">[116]</a></p>

<p>Papademetriou and Hooper reviewed the current state of border security and the challenges posed by migration in a December 2014 assessment that summarized the global trends from the past year. They view the “demand for humanitarian protection” as a significant and growing push factor.<a href="#mm117">[117]</a> The wars and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and more recently Yemen, and “a constellation of unstable states in sub-Saharan Africa, and in Central America, have outpaced the ability and political willingness of neighbors in the region and the broader international community to offer meaningful protection to all, let alone resettlement opportunities, pushing many to embark on precarious voyages.” Papademetriou and Hooper conclude that the push and pull factors causing mixed migration flows to the United States will not abate.</p>

<h5>Globalization, Technology, and Climate Change</h5>

<p>Beyond the war and conflict-related push factors, scholars have identified other global trends that are impacting and may increase migration flows. Rey Koslowski’s essay, “Economic Globalization, Human Smuggling, and Global Governance” explains that the drivers of globalization—rapidly advancing information, communication and transportation technologies— are “propelling international migration and fostering transnational crime.”<a href="#mm118">[118]</a> As noted above, smugglers now facilitate upwards of 90 percent of U.S. border crossings. Local or national crime groups have expanded to become global criminal syndicates.<a href="#mm119">[119]</a> The expansion (much like that of global business except that legal businesses deals in legal commodities) is in response to expanding markets for illegal commodities.<a href="#mm120">[120]</a> For example, the cost of human smuggling across the U.S. border has increased dramatically since border security was strengthened post-9/11, and organized crime and smugglers have tapped into that ‘market’ to provide a ‘service.’</p>

<p>Technology assists another structural factor—social networks. Historically, social networks are those that “connect migrants to host-state jobs and communities of co-nationals typically from the same village and area.”<a href="#mm121">[121]</a> Rosenblum and Brick point out that social networks are a particularly important factor for migrants from Mexico and Central America. Other than small references, primarily from interviews of migrants by journalists, it does not appear that the current literature has evaluated the role of technology in facilitating the social network factor. Several news reports covering the Central American surge in 2014, cited instances of migrants leveraging social networking—in the technological variety (e.g., Facebook)—to prepare for the journey. U.S.-based families or the migrant in his country of origin are able to more easily connect with potential smugglers, coordinate the best migration route, and facilitate payment. Additionally, rapid communication capabilities may lead to “sudden” surges. What previously may have taken a few months or years to build as a trend can occur much more quickly.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a growing set of research that asserts that climate change is likely to increase international migrations. In July 2014, Madeline Messick and Claire Bergeron surveyed recent events and unclassified National Intelligence Estimates and determined the demand for Temporary Protected Status (TPS)<a href="#mm122">[122]</a> is likely to grow for reasons beyond war and conflict.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the world adjusts to climate change, scientists predict that the number of severe weather events—such as floods, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires—will increase, forcing more people to migrate. In 2012 alone, an estimated 29 million people were displaced by extreme weather events. National intelligence estimates prepared by the U.S. intelligence community have predicted that changing weather patterns could contribute to political instability, disputes over resources, and mass migration.<a href="#mm123">[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a study that explores the methodologies for assessing environment-migration relationships, Fussell, Hunter, and Gray show that scholars and the policy community believe climate change will impact future migration.<a href="#mm124">[124]</a> They assert “most scholars in the field reject the deterministic view that directly links climate change to mass migration,” instead recognizing the linkages are complex. The study does not provide any predictions on how climate change may affect migration, but lays out suggested steps that can be taken to further advance the “scientific knowledge of environment-migration relationships and their implications for their future.”</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The perspectives from which to evaluate the risk of mass migration to the U.S. are numerous and diverse. The volume of potential literature inhibits the ability to gain a completely thorough understanding of the current research from all possible angles and disciplines. In selecting the literature for this review, we attempted to identify common themes and areas most relevant to risk assessment purposes.</p>

<p>This survey of recent surge events and the literature review indicate there is a strong likelihood of future surges to the U.S. Such surges are caused by complex structural factors that render ‘quick solutions’ unlikely.</p>

<p>Globalization, complete with cheaper access to technology, communication, and travel, will continue to lower the barriers to migration, and enable growth of the human smuggling “business.”</p>

<p>Further, the literature reviewed indicated that push factors are increasing, and that “tipping point” incidents—incidents that push the individual to migrate—are likely to increase and be more difficult to contain. Such tipping point incidents may include those caused by climate change, which creates more frequent and severe natural disasters, or by armed conflicts such as the recent coups, civil wars, and terrorist group territorial takeovers.</p>

<p>There were notable limitations in the literature as well. Other than the USCG’s National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment, which was focused solely on maritime mass migrations, publicly available literature did not provide statistics or estimates on the total protection and response-related costs per migrant, or in the case of the Central American surge, per child. More evaluation is needed to understand the economic impact of protection and response actions in a mass migration. Reviewing the most recent Central American surge could provide useful insight into costs. However, it would be applicable only to child migrants, as the processes used for unaccompanied children are different than that of apprehended adults and family units.</p>

<p>The literature reviewed did not provide an assessment of the U.S. Government’s capabilities and responses to the 2014 surge, perhaps because the events are so recent as to render a complete assessment premature. To the extent the literature assessed the U.S. Government’s actions, it tended to focus on policies and steady-state operations, not on the surge response.</p>

<p>One final limitation is that the literature reviewed mentioned, but did not evaluate in-depth, the possibility that the U.S. Government’s response to migrants contributes to the mass migration problem. While there are a number of political commentators in recent years that have argued this case, due to bias, they were not considered as part of the literature review. Academic research is needed to evaluate whether the U.S. Government’s programmatic service delivery is a potential Pull Factor and if so, how significant of a role does it play in mass migration scenarios.</p>

<p>Until recently, the U.S. Government’s experience with migrant surges was primarily related to Haitian and Cuban migrants attempting maritime entries over the past three decades. Lessons learned from the recent Central American surge (2011-2015) should be reviewed. Further research and consideration should be given to how the U.S. Government’s capabilities can be made more flexible, resilient, and comprehensive to address what many scholars believe will be a likely increase in U.S. mass migration surges.</p>

Some group the second and third wave into one wave, while others consider them separate because of different push/pull migration factors. There is also variance in the dating of the beginning of the fourth wave. Some consider it to start in 1965 at the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments of 1965, while others date it to after 1970 when the trend of increased migration occurs.</p>

The drug gang responsible for the kidnapping and murders, Los Zetas, captured its victims as they traveled through Tamaulipas, presumably on their way to cross the border illegally into the United States.

<p id="mm64">64.  On March 1, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Section 462, transferred responsibilities for the care and placement of unaccompanied children from the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).

   Since then, ORR has cared for more than 150,000 children, incorporating child welfare values as well as the principles and provisions established by the Flores Agreement in 1997, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and its reauthorization acts, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2005 and 2008. Unaccompanied children apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration officials are transferred to the care and custody of ORR. ORR makes and implements placement decisions in the best interests of the child to ensure placement in the least restrictive setting possible while in federal custody. ORR takes into consideration the unique nature of each child’s situation and incorporates child welfare principles when making placement, clinical, case management, and release decisions that are in the best interest of the child.

<p id="mm65">65.  This paper is focused on the protection and response-related responsibilities of the U.S. Government in the instance of a mass migration. There is more literature, and a wide-variety of opinion, on the long-term economic effects of immigration—both legal and illegal. Some believe that the costs for absorbing migrants into the U.S. are high as they take advantage of local, state, Federal, and private non-profit resources available (health services, education, welfare, etc.). Others point out that while there may be an initial drain on taxpayer or charitable services, the immigrants contribute to the economy in varying ways as well.</p>

<p id="mm66">66.  This assessment was based on the 1992-1994 maritime mass migration from Haiti, and as such is likely not valid for estimating the cost of mass migration at the southwest border.</p>

Since 1990, U.S. humanitarian relief has been granted to persons from certain countries suffering from wars, violence or natural disaster in the form of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). It is estimated 340,000 people currently hold TPS status. TPS is not a grant of permanent legal status in the United States. Recipients do not receive lawful permanent residence (a “green card”), nor are they eligible, based on their TPS status, to apply for permanent residence or for U.S. citizenship. Rather, TPS beneficiaries receive provisional protection against deportation and permission to work in the United States for a limited period of time. The United States can end a country’s TPS designation once it has recovered from the triggering event. See USCIS’ page on TPS at <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status-deferred-enforced-departure/temporary-protected-status">http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status-deferred-enforced-departure/temporary-protected-status</a>.

<h3>Event Background</h3>

<p>There have been eight naturally caused influenza pandemics (including pandemics subsequently deduced to have been caused by influenza virus) since 1729. <a href="#pand8">[8]</a> Thus, the historic frequency is once every 10 to 60 years. New influenza viruses that affect humans can emerge and spread rapidly. Influenza pandemics can occur at any time due in part to the following factors: the quality and scope of epidemiological and laboratory resources to identify and diagnose viruses with pandemic potential -- both in the United States and globally; the complex reassortment of new influenza viruses between animal and human hosts; potential lack of antibody resistance to new influenza virus strains in the population at large; potential resistance of new influenza virus strains to available antiviral medications; time needed to identify, develop, produce, and distribute an effective pandemic influenza vaccine; and countermeasure resources in the U.S. and globally to mitigate the transmission of a pandemic virus.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate health and safety impacts caused by a pandemic event:</p>

<ul>

<li> The scenario is based on a U.S. population of approximately 307 million.</li>

<li>Likelihood, fatality, and illness best estimates and ranges were provided to the SNRA project team by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</li>

<li>These experts stress that it is impossible to predict the timing or severity of the next pandemic.</li>

<li>All of the estimates are given absent any intervention (i.e., before interventions are applied or attempted). <a href="#pand9">[9]</a></li>

<li>The modeled National-level Event is based on assuming a 25% attack rate <a href="#pand10">[10]</a> and death rates associated with a scenario modeled on a 1957-scale pandemic if it were to occur in today’s population.  <a href="#pand11">[11]</a>, <a href="#pand12">[12]</a></li>

</ul>

<h4>Frequency</h4>

<p>Low (1/60 years), best (1/30 years), and high (1/10 years) frequency estimates reflect the historic frequency of influenza pandemics of natural origin since 1729 of once every 10 to 60 years, averaging 1 in 30 years. These correspond to the absolute likelihood of the set of pandemics as a whole: the conditional likelihood of pandemic scenarios of different severities given occurrence of a pandemic event is discussed under “Additional Relevant Information.”</p>

<h4>Fatalities and Illnesses</h4>

<p>Fatality low, best, and high estimates were calculated using an attack rate of 25%, a U.S. population of 307 million, and a case fatality rate of 0.1% - 0.3% (best: 0.2%). <a href="#pand13">[13]</a> Illness low, best, and high estimates correspond to the same U.S. population and attack rates of 20%, 25%, and 35% respectively. <a href="#pand14">[14]</a></p>

<p>Comparisons to other estimates of health and safety impacts: Large uncertainties dominate any estimate of the human impacts of the next influenza pandemic.</p>

<ul>

<li> Severity of virus: Although useful indications of the potential range of impacts may be inferred from records of the historical variability of the influenza virus (Figures 1, 2), patterns deduced from the historical record have been insufficient in themselves for constructing predictive models for the severity of the next pandemics. <a href="#pand15">[15]</a> Many planning scenarios model experts’ best judgment of a ‘most representative’ scenario, such as the 1957 scale pandemic model used for the SNRA and many other planning scenarios in this country; others model a 1918-scale pandemic as a maximal scenario for planning purposes. <a href="#pand16">[16]</a> Current U.S. Government guidance is to plan to both a ‘moderate’ 1957/1968-style pandemic and a ‘severe’ 1918-style pandemic to ensure preparedness for a range of impacts. <a href="#pand17">[17]</a></li>

<li> Mitigation measures: In addition to the inherent characteristics of the virus, the actual impacts of a future pandemic will also depend upon the availability, speed of deployment, and effectiveness of medical and non-medical measures to mitigate disease spread and lethality. Despite extensive study in the literature, <a href="#pand18">[18]</a> the extent to which the effects of the next pandemic will be mitigated in practice is dominated by open questions (see Potential Mitigating Factors).</li></ul>

<h4>Direct Economic Loss</h4>

<p>Direct economic impacts as defined in the SNRA include decontamination, disposal, and physical destruction costs including property (structure, contents, physical infrastructure, and other physical property) and crop damage; one year’s lost spending due to fatalities; medical costs; and business interruption directly resulting from the impacts of an event. For the 2015 SNRA, direct economic impacts were calculated based upon previous work done for the DHS RAPID model. <a href="#pand19">[19]</a>, <a href="#pand20">[20]</a> This method was used, because it aligned better to the harmonized SNRA definition of direct economic impact than that used for the 2011 SNRA; however, given the 2015 SNRA fatality and illness inputs, both methods gave similar results (see below).</p>

<p>The SNRA project team used the following assumptions to estimate economic impacts caused by a pandemic event:</p>

<ul>

<li>All of the estimates are given absent any intervention (i.e., before interventions are applied or attempted).</li>

<li>All estimates were converted to 2011 dollars for comparison with the existing events of the SNRA.</li>

<li><b>Decontamination, Disposal, and Physical Destruction</b> costs were assumed to be negligible in comparison with the other components of the SNRA direct economic loss measure for the Pandemic event. <a href="#pand21">[21]</a></li>

<li><b>Medical Costs:</b> The SNRA project team made the assumption that hospitalizations would dominate the medical costs for the Pandemic event. A fatality/hospitalization ratio of 11%, the midpoint of the middle (Scale 4)-level scenario of CDC’s current pandemic classification model <a href="#pand22">[22]</a> was applied to the low, best, and high fatality estimates. <a href="#pand23">[23]</a> The resulting estimates of numbers hospitalized were multiplied by $21,154, the average cost of influenza-related hospitalizations from the RAPID model adjusted to 2011 dollars, to obtain total estimated hospitalization costs. <a href="#pand24">[24]</a>, <a href="#pand25">[25]</a></li>

<li><b>Business Interruption</b> costs for the SNRA were estimated based on the workdays lost due to illnesses, including caregiver absences from work due to ill family members. The CDC FluWorkLoss model was used to estimate workdays lost for the SNRA. <a href="#pand26">[26]</a> FluWorkLoss is highly customizable to input assumptions and values. <a href="#pand27">[27]</a> However, for a given set of input assumptions, the output average total workdays lost per illness is a linear function of Case Fatality Rate (CFR) independent of attack rate, total fatalities, or pandemic duration. The relationship <a href="#pand28">[28]</a> corresponding to the FluWorkLoss default assumptions was used to estimate total workdays lost for each of the low/best/high fatality and illness scenarios. These totals, converted to total work-years lost, <a href="#pand29">[29]</a> were multiplied by the U.S. average annual output per worker of $144,654 <a href="#pand30">[30]</a> to produce estimates of total business interruption directly caused by a pandemic event.</li>

<li><b>Lost Demand from Fatalities:</b> To estimate the costs of lost demand from deaths, the SNRA project team multiplied the number of deaths listed in the Data Summary Table by $42,500, the same figure used across the SNRA 2011 events. <a href="#pand31">[31]</a></li>

<p><i>Comparisons to other estimates of economic impact:</i> The economic loss model used by the 2011 SNRA included medical costs and a partial valuation of lost productivity due to time off work. Additionally, approximately 83% of the economic impacts from the 2011 model were associated with the value of lost productivity due to premature death, a component not included in the SNRA 2015 direct economic loss metric. However, when adjusted for the updated fatality/illness inputs of the 2015 SNRA, the 2011 model has a best estimate of $116 billion, with a range of $53 to $157 billion. Although calculated by different loss estimation methods, these estimates closely coincide with those of the 2015 SNRA ($114 billion, with a range of $71 to $180 billion).</p>

<p>In comparison to the 1957-scale scenario estimates of the 2015 SNRA, a 2006 study of the potential economic impact of an influenza pandemic gave an estimate of impact for a ‘mild’ pandemic of 0.8% of global GDP, equivalent in the U.S. to approximately $117.6 billion. <a href="#pand32">[32]</a> Although calculated with a different methodology, this estimate is also within the range given in the ‘Data Summary’ for the 1957 scenario.</p>

<p>A Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href="#pand33">[33]</a> study of a 1918-type outbreak scenario, assuming two million deaths, estimated that such a pandemic would cause the U.S. GDP ($14.7 trillion) to decrease by 4.25% -- equivalent to $625 billion. This is above the range included in the Table, but it represents a comparatively less likely worst case scenario. The CBO’s ‘mild’ pandemic scenario, equivalent to the 1968 and 1957 pandemics, assumed 100,000 might die, and cause an impact of about 1 percent of GDP ($147 billion). A detailed Canadian study <a href="#pand34">[34]</a> estimated that a 1918-type pandemic would reduce the Canadian economy by a maximum of 1.1% GDP -- equivalent in the U.S. to US $161.7 billion.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>Social displacement was assumed to be zero for the Human Pandemic Outbreak national-level event. <a href="#pand35">[35]</a></p>

<p>Note that hospitalization is not counted as social displacement for the purposes of the SNRA, since it would result in double counting with illnesses. Social distancing, quarantine, large-scale telework, and children and family staying home or college students returning home as a result of school closures are also not counted as social displacement, because they result in more people staying home rather than leaving home.</p>

<h4>Psychological Distress</h4>

<p>Psychological impacts for the SNRA focus on significant distress and prolonged distress, which can encompass a variety of outcomes serious enough to impair daily role functioning and quality of life. An index for significant distress was created that reflected empirical findings that the scope and severity of an event is more important than the type of event. <a href="#pand36">[36]</a> The equation for this index uses the fatalities, injuries, and displacement associated with an event as primary inputs. A multiplicative factor elicited (in 2011) from subject matter experts (SMEs) weights the index for differing psychological impact based on the type of event, but as a secondary input.</p>

<p>The Significant Distress Index is calculated from these inputs using a formula proposed by SMEs consulted for the SNRA project: <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> = <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> × (5 <i>Fat</i> + <i>Inj</i> + ½ <i>D</i>), where <i>N<sub>SD</sub></i> represents the number of persons significantly distressed, <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> is the expert assessed Event Familiarity Factor, <i>Fat</i> is the number of fatalities, <i>Inj</i> is the number of injuries and/or illnesses, and <i>D</i> is the number of persons displaced (Social Displacement).</p>

<ul><li>In words, this formula suggests that there are 5 significantly distressed persons for each life lost; 1 for each person injured; and 1 for each 2 people displaced. This formula was constructed to reflect the empirical finding that the most severe stressor of a disaster is losing a loved one, followed by injury, followed by displacement.</li></ul>

<p>The Event Familiarity Factor is intended to capture the extent to which the event entails an ongoing threat with uncertainty regarding long-term effects, is unfamiliar, or that people dread, exacerbating psychological impacts. This factor, ranging from 1.0 for familiar events to 1.3 for unfamiliar events, was provided by SMEs for each national-level event included in the SNRA: Human Pandemic Outbreak was given a <i>C<sub>EF</sub></i> of 1.0.</p>

<ul><li>Uncertainty was captured by applying the index formula to the low, best, and high estimates of these three human impact metrics.</li></ul>

<p>The numerical outputs of this index formula were used to assign events to bins of a risk matrix for a semi-quantitative analysis of psychological risk in the SNRA. <a href="#pand37">[37]</a></p>

<h4>Environmental Impact</h4>

<p>In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event in the first iteration of the SNRA. Estimates are based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Experts were elicited to provide estimates in the environmental impact category based on assumptions. Actual environmental/ecological harm that occurs as a result of the events described in a given scenario may vary considerably, and will depend on numerous variables (e.g., chemical or biological agent, contamination extent, persistence, toxicity -- both chronic and acute toxicity -- and infectivity).</li>

<li>EPA defined environmental consequence (impact) <a href="#pand38">[38]</a> as the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment by effluents, emissions, wastes, or accidental chemical releases; energy use; or the depletion of natural resources.</li>

<li>The experts provided a best estimate of ‘Moderate’ for a pandemic scenario with severe social impacts and a second best estimate of ‘Low’ for a less severe pandemic scenario.</li>

<li>The 2015 SNRA reports the ‘Low’ environmental impact judgment as the best estimate for the Pandemic event because the social impacts of the best estimate scenario, as defined by the best estimates on other impact axes, correspond to the less severe pandemic scenario. The 2015 SNRA reports ‘Moderate’ as the second best judgment, because it describes the environmental impacts of a more severe pandemic scenario.</li>

<li>Experts identified the impacts of a larger pandemic scenario as ‘Moderate’ due to the potential for resources to be pulled from environmental protection activities, thereby allowing impacts to cascade and cause environmental impacts. If the pandemic were large enough, environmental protection could be deemphasized in order to divert resources towards higher priority response efforts, and impacts could be increased as service providers are afflicted with the pandemic (e.g., waste disposal efforts could be halted if workers require treatment).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>Numerous medical and non-medical measures for mitigating the human impacts of an influenza pandemic, including social distancing, school closing, antiviral medications, antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections, and targeted vaccines, are known and would be expected to be deployed, at least in part. These measures' efficacy for those individuals who directly receive them is clearly indicated by the evidence in the literature. However, there is no consensus in the literature on what proportional or percentage reductions in total national fatalities and illnesses could be expected under the constraints and conditions of an actual pandemic. <a href="#pand39">[39]</a> Estimates of percentage reductions (mitigation effectiveness) in the literature range from 1.6% <a href="#pand40">[40]</a> to 96% <a href="#pand41">[41]</a> for fatalities and 6% <a href="#pand42">[42]</a> to 99% <a href="#pand43">[43]</a> for illnesses respectively.</p>

<p>The appropriate factor for converting the currently unmitigated impact numbers to mitigated equivalents is not known. However, recent CDC studies of the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic suggest that any adjustment for mitigation under real-world societal and economic conditions would not substantially shift the numbers reported here. <a href="#pand44">[44]</a></p>

<h3>Additional Relevant Information</h3>

<p>The probability of impact due to a pandemic has two parts: the probability of a pandemic (any type) occurring, and then, once it has occurred, the severity of impact (essentially, the conditional probability that the ‘mild’, ‘middle’, or ‘worst case’ scenario occurs).</p>

<p><i>Probability of a pandemic occurring:</i> From 1729 through 2009 there have been 8-12 influenza pandemics (including pandemics subsequently deduced to have been caused by influenza virus). <a href="#pand45">[45]</a> They have thus historically occurred with a frequency of once every 10 to 60 years.</p>

<p><i>Probability of severity</i> (probability of ‘mild’, ‘middle’, or ‘worst case’ occurring once pandemic has started): The 1918 pandemic appears to have caused an exceptionally high case fatality rate. Such a pandemic could, in theory, reoccur but historically has only occurred once in approximately 8-12 pandemics. This historical frequency gives an approximately 10% chance that the next pandemic will be a 1918-type pandemic. Similarly, a ‘mild’ pandemic, such as the 2009 pandemic, has only occurred once in 8-12 pandemics since 1700 and also has an approximate 10% probability of occurring. If one includes both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics as examples of ‘mild’ impact pandemics, then the probability that such a scenario will occur rises to 30%. The probability of a ‘middle’ scenario occurring is the residual after accounting for the probabilities of both ‘worst case’ and ‘mild’ scenarios (range for a ‘middle’: 50%-80%).</p>

<h4>Visualizing the time series of influenza pandemics, 1700-present</h4>

<p>Quantitative study of mortality from historical influenza pandemics has focused almost entirely on the twentieth century. However, sufficient data on prior events exist for researchers to depict time series of historical pandemics over longer periods for mortality in selected populations. While differences in base population, <a href="#pand46">[46]</a> health, counting measures, and population age structures prevent precise comparisons, such estimates can be nonetheless arrayed together to get a rough picture of the historical variability of the influenza virus in terms of its effects on the human population (Figure 1). <a href="#pand47">[47]</a> The exceptional scale of the 1918-20 pandemic compared with other pandemics is immediately apparent.</p>

</figure>

<h4>Influenza pandemics: Historical range of impacts</h4>

<p>Each of the population attack rate (25%) and the case fatality rate (0.2%) selected as the basis of the best estimate pandemic scenario in the SNRA represents the geometric midpoint of the corresponding range (attack rate 20%<a href="#pand48">[48]</a> - 31.6%<a href="#pand49">[49]</a>, CFR 0.02%<a href="#pand50">[50]</a> - 2.0%<a href="#pand51">[51]</a>) observed in the influenza pandemics of the past century in the U.S. This suggests a logarithmic distribution on each axis of impact.</p>

<p>To represent a broader range of pandemic impacts beyond the comparatively narrow range of the SNRA Pandemic scenario and to permit comparisons and aggregations with other SNRA events, the uncertainty in each of these two parameters was represented by a log-uniform distribution over the historically observed intervals presented above. As fatalities represent the product of these two parameters (Table 3), the distribution of fatalities is given by the product of these two distributions (Table 4). <a href="#pand52">[52]</a></p>

<p>This model was constructed so that the uncertainties in our knowledge of the conditional distribution of pandemic impacts can be represented in calculations comparing or combining human pandemic risk with other risks in the SNRA, as opposed to the use of point estimates or a narrowly defined scenario. However, a surprising and somewhat disturbing outcome is how closely this model parallels the actual historical variability of the influenza virus, in terms of fatalities projected to the U.S. population of today, over its known 300-year history (Figure 2).</p>

<p>The historical data (projected to current U.S. population) of Figure 1 is depicted in Figure 2 as an exceedance curve in semi-logarithmic space. When viewed on a logarithmic scale, the 1918 pandemic appears less exceptional compared with the other historical influenza pandemics of natural origin of the past three centuries.</p>

<p>While multiple factors affecting both likelihood and impacts substantially differ between the present day and the past, this comparative view can be useful for understanding the inherent variability of the influenza virus.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p id="pand1">1.&nbsp; Fatality low, best, and high estimates were calculated using an attack rate of 25%, a U.S. population of 307 million, and a case fatality rate of 0.1% - 0.3% (best: 0.2%). Reed et al (2013, January). Novel framework for assessing epidemiologic effects of influenza epidemics and pandemics; and Technical Appendix. <i>Emerging Infectious Diseases</i> 19(1) 85-91, at <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/1/12-0124_article">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/1/12-0124_article</a>; Technical Appendix at <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/1/12-0124-techapp1.pdf">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/1/12-0124-techapp1.pdf</a> (retrieved June 2013).</p>

<p id="pand2">2.&nbsp; Illness low, best, and high estimates correspond to a U.S. population of 307 million and attack rates of 20%, 25%, and 35% respectively.</p>

<p id="pand3">3.&nbsp; Sum of estimated hospitalization costs, business interruption from workdays lost, and one year&rsquo;s lost spending per fatality. See Direct Economic Impact for details.</p>

<p id="pand4">4.&nbsp; Social displacement was assumed to be zero for the Human Pandemic Outbreak national-level event.</p>

<p id="pand5">5.&nbsp; In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened an ad hoc group of environmental experts representing the fields of environmental science, ecological risk, toxicology, and disaster field operations management to estimate environmental impacts for this event. The comments and rankings presented in this Risk Summary Sheet have not undergone review by the EPA and only represent the opinions of the group.  Estimates pertain to the potential for adverse effects on living organisms associated with pollution of the environment; they are grouped into high, moderate, low, and de minimus (none) categories.</p>

<p id="pand6">6.&nbsp; Experts provided both first and second choice categories, allowing the experts to express uncertainty in their judgments as well as reflect the range of potential effects that might result depending on the specifics of the event. The experts provided a best estimate of ‘Moderate’ for a pandemic scenario with severe social impacts and a second best estimate of ‘Low’ for a less severe pandemic scenario (see Environmental Impacts). The SNRA used ‘Low’ as the best estimate and ‘Moderate’ as the second best estimate for the Pandemic national-level event, because the final numbers on other impact scales defined a scenario with social impacts corresponding to the less severe as opposed to the more severe pandemic scenario.</p>

<p id="pand7">7.&nbsp; The SNRA data tables are presented differently for Pandemic than for other national-level events to address partner risk communication concerns that are specific for pandemic influenza. The same information is presented as in other data tables, but additional information is also presented.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The frequency estimates (0.017/year, 0.033/year, 0.10/year) in the top row of Table 1A represent the likelihood of occurrence of the set of influenza pandemic events as a whole, not the conditional or absolute likelihoods of occurrence of the low, best, and high impact estimates in particular. (Low, best, and high impact estimates also do not necessarily correlate with each other across impact metric, e.g. the high estimates of fatalities, illnesses, and direct economic impacts do not necessarily correlate together in a single scenario.) The overall frequency of occurrence of an event and the conditional probabilities of an incident having low, moderate, or high impacts are independent variables. The top row frequency estimates are the low, best, and high frequencies indicated on the SNRA s comparative charts.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The approximate likelihoods of the ‘mild’ (10-30%), ‘middle’ (50-80%), and ‘severe/worst case’ (~10%) scenarios as described under “Additional Relevant Information,” given occurrence of an influenza pandemic in the set as a whole, are listed in the first vertical column to the left. Similarly to the frequency of occurrence of pandemics as a whole, these conditional likelihoods have substantial uncertainties associated with them, and so are represented as ranges. Given the occurrence of an influenza pandemic, these represent the probabilities that the pandemic will be ‘mild’, ‘middle’, or ‘severe/worst case’. Note that the designation ‘mild’ is strictly relative: the least severe historical instance of a ‘mild’ pandemic, the 2009 H1N1 influenza, killed more Americans than any other natural or accidental hazard incident or modeled scenario in the SNRA data set. Note also that these three categories do not correspond to the low, best, and high impact estimates of the SNRA Pandemic event as given in Table 1A: the SNRA low, best, and high impact estimates reflect a broad 1957-like pandemic scenario, and the range of impacts described by the SNRA scenario straddle the boundary of the ‘mild’ and ‘middle’ categories described in Table 1B and “Additional Relevant Information.”  The range of impacts for the SNRA Pandemic event correspond to a high-’mild’ to a ‘middle’ scenario.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The absolute frequency of each of the ‘mild’, ‘middle’, and “worst case” scenarios described under “Additional Relevant Information” would be the product of the 0.017 - 0.10 / year absolute frequency of the Pandemic event as a whole and their approximate conditional likelihoods of 10-30%, 50-80%, and 10% respectively, or 0.002 - 0.03, 0.008 - 0.08, and 0.002 - 0.01 / year. These are presented in the body of Table 1B. Because of the multiple uncertainties involved with pandemic likelihoods, only the ranges (the high and low of each product) are considered to be informationally meaningful: these are colored in violet.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For additional detail, see “Additional Relevant Information” and associated discussion.</p>

<p id="pand8">8.&nbsp; Different authors have different lists of which influenza years they consider to have been pandemics, but most modern writers’ lists of likely influenza pandemics in the past three centuries include from about 8 to 12 events in total (when the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is included). Serological studies -- blood tests to characterize antigens to surface proteins of influenza viruses a person may have been exposed to in his/her lifetime -- have been successfully used to determine the serotypes (combinations of particular H and N surface proteins) of influenza outbreaks back to around 1900. However, making a determination of which historical outbreaks before that point were pandemics by the modern virological definition from past writers  observations indicative of a new influenza serotype (e.g., cross-continent spread, patterns of residual immunity from previous outbreaks) involves a great deal of inference and human judgment.

However, the larger fraction of these high-risk subpopulations in today’s U.S. population -- due in large part to these same advances -- means that total fatalities from an influenza pandemic of similar virulence could be much higher today than in 1957.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The SNRA project team is not aware of any longitudinal study looking at the proportion of high-risk populations defined in comparable terms. However, the scale of this increase is apparent in studies of the U.S. populations covering shorter time periods. One illustration of this is the increase of the overall percentage of the U.S. population at high risk from complications of influenza from 15.5% to 20% in the five year period 1973-1978: Table 12, Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress (1981, December), Cost Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccination.

<p id="pand19">19.&nbsp; The Risk Assessment Process for Informed Decision Making (RAPID) 2010 (or RAPID II) was a strategic level, DHS-wide process to assess risk and inform strategic planning priorities developed by the DHS Office of Risk Management & Analysis (National Protection & Programs Directorate).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The RAPID engine is a suite of computational tools for calculating human and economic measures of risk and the relative effectiveness of different DHS programs in risk reduction. Like the SNRA it is a quantitative tool for calculating and comparing risks in the homeland security mission space with each other, but unlike the SNRA it is designed for additionally calculating the comparative effectiveness of different programs in buying down risk. RAPID is presently maintained by the DHS Office of Policy.</p>
 
<p id="pand20">20.&nbsp; Note that the following is based on work done in developing the RAPID model, not the model itself. Common inputs include average hospitalization costs and direct business interruption costs per workday lost.</p>

<p id="pand21">21.&nbsp; This assumption may not hold true for an extremely severe pandemic causing social disruption on the scale of the 1918 pandemic: see Environmental Impact section below, discussion of Moderate impact estimate.</p>

<p id="pand22">22.&nbsp; Scales as in Reed et al (2013).</p>

<p id="pand23">23.&nbsp; A constant ratio was used because the correlation of this measure to other measures across different scale scenarios was unknown: the different severity measures of the Reed model are used as inputs to determine a severity level and do not represent a prediction that these scenarios will be correlated in a real world pandemic event. As a sensitivity analysis, a functional relationship between this ratio and case fatality rates at the boundaries of each scenario (e.g. 0.05% CFR and 6.5% fatality/hospitalized ratio at the scale 2-scale 3 boundary) of (fatality / hospitalized) = 0.0374 ln(CFR) + 0.3516 [<i>r</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> = 0.9986] was assumed and applied to the low/best/high fatality-illness scenarios to obtain fatality / hospitalized ratios of 9.3%, 11.9%, and 13.4% respectively. This resulted in total direct economic impacts of $74 / $112 / $172 billion respectively, compared with $71 / $114 / $180 billion total direct economic impacts of the final SNRA 2015 estimates.</p>

<p id="pand24">24.&nbsp; Similarly to the DHS Terrorism Risk Assessments, RAPID estimates of hospitalization costs were derived from the Nationwide Impatient Sample (NIS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and are based on a five-day hospitalization ($18,367 in $2005).

<p id="pand35">35.&nbsp; For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer.

However, this distinction is less relevant for events with zero displacement on either measure.</p>

<p id="pand38">38.&nbsp; The 2011 SNRA referred to impacts as ‘consequences’ because of prior usage in quantitative risk assessment (Kaplan and Garrick [1981, March], On the quantitative definition of risk: <i>Risk Analysis</i> 1(1) 11-32). Except where it will cause confusion, ‘impact’ is used synonymously in this document because of pre-existing connotations of the word ‘consequence’ within FEMA.</p>

<p id="pand39">39.&nbsp; E.g. not everyone who is sick can afford going to the doctor or antiviral prescriptions; research and production times needed to mass produce vaccines targeted to the pandemic virus may delay their mass availability until after the pandemic’s peak.</p>

In this case, since we do not know much about the true distribution other than the extremes which have been observed and our observation that more events have occurred between these extremes than at them, uniform distributions are the most accurate representation of our state of knowledge.

<h3>Event Background</h3>

<blockquote><p>Utility executives and Federal energy officials have long worried that the electric grid is vulnerable to sabotage. That is in part because the grid, which is really three systems serving different areas of the U.S., [had failures impacting a large number of customers] when small problems such as trees hitting transmission lines created cascading blackouts. … Many of the system’s most important components sit out in the open, often in remote locations, protected by little more than cameras and chain-link fences. <a href="#papg19">[19]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>From 2011 <a href="#papg20">[20]</a> to 2014, <a href="#papg21">[21]</a> there were 322 <a href="#papg22">[22]</a> reported incidents of alleged or confirmed sabotage, physical attack and vandalism <a href="#papg23">[23]</a> to different parts of U.S. utilities. These cases represented about 35 percent of all incidents <a href="#papg24">[24]</a> reported to the U.S. Department of Energy that posed a risk to the grid. Most had little effect, <a href="#papg25">[25]</a> but some resulted in measureable impacts. The well-known incident at the Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Company’s Metcalf Transmission Substation outside of San Jose, California, for example, had widely reported estimates of $15 million <a href="#papg26">[26]</a> in damages and the potential for more serious impacts because the PG&E Metcalf substation provides power to California’s Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>In the U.S., there is no single interconnected national grid. Instead, the continental U.S. is served by three separate grids, which are largely not impacted by the failure or resiliency of the others. It is feasible for coordinated events to impact more than one of the grids within the U.S., but it is highly unlikely that an attack within one grid could cascade and impact the others.</p>

<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 1: Interconnections and Reliability Regions <a href="#papg27">[27]</a></figcaption>
    <img src="SNRA physical attack on the power grid rss_files/nerc-map-us-electric-grid.svg">
</figure>

<p>The three separate networks are:</p>

<ul><li>The Western Interconnection, which serves those contiguous states west of the Rockies as well as their Canadian neighbors and portions of Northwestern Mexico.</li>

<li>The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which serves only the state of Texas.</li>

<li>The Eastern and Quebec Interconnection which serves all states (and Canadian Provinces) east of the Rockies and south of the Great Lakes and New York. The Eastern Interconnection is actually made up of multiple interconnected but separately managed grids, allowing some cascading failures but also additional resiliencies within this large, heavily populated area.</li></ul>

<p>To date, “no major power outage in the Western world has originated from an antagonistic attack, [and]… there are few publicly reported sabotage attempts (near-misses).” <a href="#papg28">[28]</a> However, two recent accidental causes of domestic power outages are worth noting, as they serve as examples of what malicious attacks could feasibly achieve:</p>

<ul><li>In February 2008, a small, isolated fire in a substation on the outskirts of Miami “caused a cascading regional grid collapse—including the Turkey Point nuclear power plant south of Miami—as electricity demand suddenly outstripped what was being produced. Some three million people from South Beach to Tampa to Daytona Beach lost power” <a href="#papg29">[29]</a> for a few hours.</li>

<li>In 2011, a human error at an Arizona substation tripped a 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line and cut power to 1.6 million customers in Arizona and southern California. The majority of customers were located in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory, and about four million customers were without power. Most customers were without power for just a few hours; however, about 1.4 million of those affected were without power for anywhere from 11 <a href="#papg30">[30]</a> to 13 <a href="#papg31">[31]</a> hours.</li></ul>

<p>Overall, a significant limitation to estimating risk from this threat is a lack of publicly available information on the electric grid and its resiliency. “Detailed analyses of these grids are, naturally, conducted by the network operators, but are seldom published for business and operational security reasons.” <a href="#papg32">[32]</a> Generally speaking, anyone could learn about “transformer vulnerabilities from engineers and operators experienced with this technology, either domestically or abroad, since the same technology is used in power grids throughout the world.” <a href="#papg33">[33]</a> Furthermore, knowledge of transformer locations themselves is also relatively easy to gain, such as by viewing images on mapping websites or following the path of high-transmission power lines back to their source.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this assessment, the 2003 Northeast Blackout could be used as a starting point to estimate potential impacts, but it would be difficult to estimate <a href="#papg34">[34]</a> how long a blackout caused by this type of an event would last. Rather than a nationwide or near-nationwide outage, this analysis assumes the outage will affect a metropolitan area. For any blackout, the amount of time <a href="#papg35">[35]</a> it lasted would dictate the severity of the impacts. If a large blackout were to happen because of an adversarial attack, there is one variable that makes it difficult to know how long it would last: the unproven domestic manufacturing capacity to rapidly replace damaged transformers. <a href="#papg36">[36]</a> “Today, there is limited manufacturing capacity in the United States for [high-voltage] transformers. Five U.S. facilities <a href="#papg37">[37]</a> state that they can manufacture transformers rated 345 kV or above, although it is not clear how many units in this range they have actually produced. Canada and Mexico have five additional [high-voltage transformer] manufacturing plants.” <a href="#papg38">[38]</a> The estimated capacity of the five U.S. plants is about a typical year’s imports, which in 2013 <a href="#papg39">[39]</a> was almost 500 transformers of various types. However, it is still unclear how rapidly these facilities could build and transport the high-voltage transformers necessary to rapidly fix a critical substation. It will be important to monitor demonstrated domestic manufacturing capacity, as measured by domestic plants successfully manufacturing high-voltage transformers for domestic utilization.</p>

<p>At the most extreme, there a nationwide failure across multiple interconnections of the U.S. power grid because of an adversarial attack could lead to a catastrophic outage across the country. One scenario could result from attackers causing the loss of power for one of the three grids through a coordinated attack on the critical substations for a specific grid: “four in the East, three in the West and two in Texas.” <a href="#papg40">[40]</a> However, there is a high degree of uncertainty around whether it would even be possible to simultaneously sabotage critical substations across the interconnections and how many substations would need to be sabotaged in order to cripple the grids, so it is only mentioned here as an area of further study.</p>

<p>Some scholars have created electric grid models to project and estimate potential effects, and they found that consequences were more likely to come <a href="#papg41">[41]</a> from attacks executed by organized groups as opposed to opportunistic individuals. However, “trying to quantitatively evaluate the probability of such low-probability–high-consequence potential terrorist attacks is very challenging, resource-demanding, and subject to inaccuracies.” <a href="#papg42">[42]</a> Ultimately, because of this type of uncertainty, this analysis does not make a determination as to the feasibility or probability of a successful attack causing a nationwide or near-nationwide blackout. To more clearly establish the potential risk of attacks, more complete data is needed from owners and operators regarding the impacts of incidents, identification and prioritization of critical assets, models of scenarios and outcomes, and tests of the grid’s resiliency. Without additional information, “the true vulnerability of the grid to a[n]…attack remains an open question.” <a href="#papg43">[43]</a> However, there is data to conclude that physical attacks on the electric grid are a documented, reoccurring risk, and they will likely continue to happen. Additionally, based on the historical evidence on accidental incidents causing outages, it remains possible for well-planned adversarial actors to cause a blackout.</p>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>There are two types of motivations that frame how an adversarial actor could approach an attack: causing as much damage as possible to the grid itself or causing a blackout to a large area.  Attacks to the grid that cause medium-term load shedding require significant resources and “will lead to a longer-lasting system ‘pain,’ and the element replacement/repair costs might be higher.” <a href="#papg44">[44]</a> However, these impacts are largely not visible to the public. On the other hand, causing short-term cascading outages requires fewer resources and causes less damage <a href="#papg45">[45]</a> to the grid itself; however, because of automated self-protection measures built into the system itself, these types of events are more likely to cause blackouts. Because so much economic and societal activity is dependent on electricity, blackouts have the ability to cause wider damages beyond the grid itself. Plus, “the U.S. electric power grid has historically operated with such high reliability that any major disruption, either caused by weather, operational errors, or sabotage, makes news headlines.” <a href="#papg46">[46]</a></p>

<p>Therefore, while it is “difficult to accurately understand the objective of the terrorists” <a href="#papg47">[47]</a> or others with malicious intent, it is assumed that the intent of an adversarial attack would be to cause a blackout rather than maximize damage to the grid itself. There is also evidence of this method being a preferred approach of adversarial actors. For example, one white supremacist group posted the following in a manual on sabotage:</p>

<blockquote><p>The power generation and distribution systems of most major Western cities are surprisingly vulnerable.... Attacking during peak consumption times (Winter in cold climates and Summer in hot climates) will make power diversion impossible.... Arson, explosives or long-range rifle fire can be used to disable substations, transformers and suspension pylons. A simultaneous attack against a number of these targets can shut down power ... with the advantage that service cannot be quickly restored by diverting power from another source. Each broken link in the power grid must be repaired in order to fully restore service. An individual, equipped with a silenced rifle or pistol, could easily destroy dozens of power transformers in a very short period of time. <a href="#papg48">[48]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The magnitude (the size of the outage) and duration (length of disruption), of an outage affect the impacts of an event. <a href="#papg49">[49]</a> For the purposes of this assessment, the low, best, and high estimates, we have made the following assumptions.</p>

<ul><li>For the low estimate magnitude, the assumption is that there is a successful attack on the grid infrastructure that causes damage but that the grid is able to offload power and prevent a power outage or disruption. In the low scenario, assumptions about timing and duration are insignificant.</li>

<li>However, for the high estimate scenario, this assessment assumes that the attack is successful and causes a power outage, the outage affects a metropolitan area in the continental U.S., and the outage lasts for one day, which is consistent with the outage across the Northeast in August 2003. <a href="#papg50">[50]</a></li>

<li>The best estimate scenario assumes the attack is successful and causes a power outage, the outage affects a metropolitan area in the continental U.S., and the outage lasts for three hours. The best estimate duration is based on the lengths of the accidental outages discussed in the event background section. In order to estimate the impacts of an outage for the best estimate scenario, this assessment assumes the size of the population affected is 2,138,460. This population size represents the median population size for the 50 largest metropolitan urban areas as captured in the 2010 census. <a href="#papg51">[51]</a></li></ul>

<p>In order to inform the impact estimates, this summary sheet assesses the risk from a national perspective, average and general data is used in the economic impacts section. This allows for a general calculation to be made; however, if this risk were to be assessed for a specific locality or metropolitan area, specific factors would need to be considered:</p>

<ul><li>Industries that make up the local economy—especially those in manufacturing or information technology that can be significantly affected by even momentary lapses in power</li>

<li>Mitigation measures for blackouts that have been taken by companies with significant local economic output</li>

<li>Seasonal changes in weather patterns (i.e., very hot or very cold temperatures) and their potential stress on the electric grid</li>

<li>Resiliency of the electric grid in that particular community</li></ul>

<h4>Health & Safety Impacts</h4>

<p>Based on the assumptions made in this assessment about the magnitude and duration of a potential outage for the low and best estimate scenario, any health and safety impacts would most likely be limited to a few individuals and would likely be within a community’s existing public health capacity to address. At the low end, the power being out for a few minutes or even a few hours, it is unlikely to cause any noticeable impact. Instead, the most pronounced impacts are likely to be caused by any power disruptions themselves.</p>

<p>However, there is historical evidence to suggest that health and safety impacts for a multi-day outage, as assumed in the high estimate, would be significant. The August 2003 blackout’s impact in New York City (not the entire region) presents a potential scenario. In this case, “respiratory device failure (mechanical ventilators, positive pressure breathing assist devices, nebulizers, and oxygen compressors) was responsible for the greatest burden” <a href="#papg52">[52]</a> on the city’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. These issues were primarily caused by heat, poor air quality and exertion from disabled mass transit systems, but they may also have been “aggravated by a fourth factor: the psychological stress of not knowing what had happened, not knowing what else might happen, not knowing how to get home, and worrying about loved ones.” <a href="#papg53">[53]</a> Subsequent studies identified approximately 90 excess fatalities and 400 excess illnesses attributable to the blackout in New York City. <a href="#papg54">[54]</a>, <a href="#papg55">[55]</a></p>

<p>As noted above, the low and best estimates of fatalities and injuries/illnesses were zero by assumption. The best estimates were scaled to the high estimate, in proportion to the total population without power and outage duration. As noted above, of the physical parameters defining the best estimate across impact categories total population affected numbered totaled 2,138,460 and duration 1/8 of a day (3/24 hours). Scaled in proportion to the 90 fatalities and 400 illnesses from the high estimate event with 50,000,000 people out of power for one day (see below), this scenario results in 0.48 fatalities and 2.13 illnesses. Because the best estimate physical model is derived from a median and because of the uncertainties involved, these were rounded to the nearest integer for best estimates of 0 fatalities and 2 illnesses rather than kept as fractional numbers in the manner of other SNRA best estimates representing averages of a distribution or set.</p>

<h4>Economic Impacts</h4>

<p>There are several types of economic impacts that the Nation could face from an adversarial attack on one or more continental U.S. interconnections. There is the cost to the utility owners to repair damage to their electrical infrastructure (e.g. transmission lines, transformers, and substations). These costs can be significant, particularly since transformers are difficult to build and are typically customized to their exact location, which makes stockpiling supplies difficult. This assessment relies on the 2013 Metcalf incident to form the low economic damage value. In the case of the Metcalf attack, estimates of $15 million <a href="#papg56">[56]</a> in damages were widely reported for transformers that were damaged but not in need of replacement. Had all of the 17 transformers suffered damage and needed to be replaced, it could have cost as much as $102 million, based on an approximate cost of $6 million <a href="#papg57">[57]</a> per transformer. In the case of the Metcalf substation disruption, there were no outages, so for the purpose of this assessment $15.11 <a href="#papg58">[58]</a> million in direct economic costs forms the low estimate for economic impacts.</p>

<p>In addition to the physical damage to infrastructure, a successful outage (as is assumed in the best and high estimate scenarios) would cause additional direct economic loss. For the best estimate, which assumes that a U.S. metropolitan city of 2,138,460 experiences a three-hour outage, this assessment uses the benefit-cost analysis (BCA) methodology developed by FEMA in 2011. According to the BCA methodology, electricity disruption <a href="#papg59">[59]</a> on economic activity would cost $114.39 per capita per day in direct economic costs. <a href="#papg60">[60]</a> Since the analysis assumes the outage is three hours, the economic cost per three hours in 2015 terms is $14.30 per capita. By multiplying it across the population, the best estimate for direct economic impact is $30.58 million for the cost of the outage itself, or $46 million for total direct economic impact including the $15.11 million cost of damaged infrastructure.</p>

<p>For the high estimate, this assessment again uses the BCA guidance from FEMA. Based on historical evidence from the Northeast Blackout, the high estimate assumes there will be 50 million people affected for one day and using the direct impact on the economy of $114.39 per capita per day (in 2015 terms) from FEMA’s BCA, the outage would cost $5.72 billion in direct economic loss. <a href="#papg61">[61]</a></p>

<p>Due to the limitations of available research, there are other variables that would affect economic impacts that were not included in the scenario development—namely the fragility of businesses, mitigation steps that has already been taken, and the timing of the event. These variables warrant further discussion and study, but it is worth noting that some businesses are more fragile than others with regards to a power outage. Some sectors <a href="#papg62">[62]</a> are particularly vulnerable to even momentary lapses in power. One researcher notes “even a one-second outage can damage equipment and disrupt highly sensitive operations to the point where labor becomes idled as systems are reset and brought back online.” <a href="#papg63">[63]</a> Nationally, these types of highly electricity- dependent companies “account for approximately 40 percent <a href="#papg64">[64]</a> of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP)” <a href="#papg65">[65]</a> even though they represent less than 20 percent of all U.S. business establishments. In order to evaluate the vulnerability of businesses to a blackout, it is important to understand how companies have mitigated their vulnerability to blackouts. Some companies have installed backup generators to prevent lapses in power, while other businesses and economic activities are naturally more resilient66 to lapses in power. For example, an analysis <a href="#papg67">[67]</a> based on self-reported estimates from businesses estimated that three-quarters of companies would experience no costs from a one-second outage, half of all businesses would not suffer measurable costs from a three-minute outage, and a quarter would not experience real costs from a one-hour outage. Additional research would need to be done to determine how widespread these mitigation actions may be on a national level and how instantaneously they can provide replacement electricity.</p>

<p>The direct costs associated with a loss of power are also impacted by the time of year when the blackout happens. For example, some costs, such as food spoilage and transportation, are dependent on season/weather and time of day. Residential costs -- such as the purchase of wood for home heating, alternative light sources, food spoilage, or damage to electrical equipment -- are “a fraction of those incurred by end-users in the other sectors” <a href="#papg68">[68]</a> and largely dependent on the timing <a href="#papg69">[69]</a> of a blackout.</p>

<p>Although rigorous study on the indirect costs of an outage was not fully analyzed within this assessment, research has been done to look at the indirect costs of an outage. Researchers noted “there are several types of indirect costs (e.g., accidental injuries, looting, vandalism, legal costs, loss of water supply, insurance rate increases) with monetary impacts that, in some cases, may exceed direct costs. In fact, an analysis of the interruption costs incurred as a result of the 1977 New York City blackout estimated that the indirect costs of the blackout exceeded direct costs by a margin of 5 to 1.” <a href="#papg70">[70]</a>While this has the potential to significantly increase the economic impacts of an intentional disruption to the electrical grid, additional research is required to determine the impacts of indirect costs.</p>

<h4>Social Displacement</h4>

<p>For the purposes of the SNRA, social displacement was defined as the number of people forced to leave home for a period of two days or longer. Note that there are limitations to this measure of social displacement, as the significant differences between temporary evacuations and permanent displacement due to property destruction are not captured.</p>

<p>Unlike the Space Weather event, the physical scenarios used as the basis of the impact estimates for the Physical Attack on the Power Grid event included only comparatively short-term outages. Additionally, the SNRA project team was not able to find records of people who were displaced from their homes from two or more days due to the 2003 East Coast Blackout, the historical event used to model the high impact estimates. <a href="#papg71">[71]</a> For these reasons, the SNRA project team made the assumption that the number of persons displaced from their homes would be zero for all three of the low, best, and high estimates.</p>

<h4>Psychological Impacts</h4>

<p>The SNRA metric of psychological distress includes a scaling factor for each event, which was elicited from subject matter experts in 2011 for the first iteration of the SNRA. Although these factors have a strong regularity across the accidental and natural hazards which enabled the provisional determination of factors for many of the new hazard events in the 2015 SNRA, this is not true of the adversarial events. For this reason, the 2015 SNRA does not report psychological distress estimates for the Physical Attack on the Power Grid event.</p>

<h4>Environmental Impacts</h4>

<p>The environmental impact estimate, which was assessed for the 23 original national-level events of the 2011 SNRA by subject matter experts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), could not be assessed for the Physical Attack on the Power Grid threat event which was added to the SNRA in calendar year 2015.</p>

<p>To support the comparative analysis of the SNRA, the SNRA 2015 project team made a provisional assignment of environmental impact on the same scale as the 2011 events based upon the closely analogous Cyber Attack against Physical Infrastructure national-level event, which was assessed by the EPA experts in 2011.</p>

<p>For a power outage caused by a malevolent actor attacking the grid (with cyber as opposed to physical means), the 2011 experts identified the best estimate of environmental impact as <i>De Minimus</i> or none.</p>

<ul><li>Experts indicated, however, that this depends on the duration of the event. If the impacts of a power outage event occur for longer than a few days, then backup systems for sewage plants, chemical facilities, and other infrastructure could fail and result in more severe environmental impacts. The experts provided a Second Best estimate of Low for the environmental impacts of such a longer duration scenario.</li></ul>

<p>The SNRA project team assigned a provisional Best estimate of De Minimus and a provisional Second Best estimate of Low for the environmental impacts of the Physical Attack on the Power Grid threat event. It must be stressed that this assignment has not been reviewed by the 2011 subject matter experts or by the EPA.</p>

<p>A future iteration of the SNRA will assess the environmental impacts of this event directly.</p>

<h3>Potential Mitigating Factors</h3>

<p>In March 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) <a href="#papg72">[72]</a> determined that physical attacks “could adversely impact the reliable operation of the Bulk-Power System, <a href="#papg73">[73]</a> resulting in instability, uncontrolled separation, or cascading failures.” <a href="#papg74">[74]</a> FERC’s intent is to require owners and operators of the Bulk-Power System to improve their resiliency from physical attacks by doing the following:</p>

<ul><li>Identify which of their facilities are the most critical to the bulk-power system</li>

<li>Assess those facilities’ risk to physical attacks</li>

<li>Have those assessments be verified by an appropriate third-party</li>

<li>Develop and implement a security plan based on those risks</li></ul>

<p>The existence of reliability standards themselves may not be enough to mitigate risk if they are not properly followed and enforced.</p>

<p>At this time, the rule-making process has not yet been completed, and it will still take additional time to be fully implemented. In the meantime, another key form of mitigation is already taken place: voluntary actions by the industry. For example, California-based PG&E announced plans to spend $100 million <a href="#papg75">[75]</a> to improve the security of its critical facilities, and a subsequent robbery <a href="#papg76">[76]</a> at the Metcalf substation in the months following the attack further reinforced the need for these improvements. In the short-term, voluntary risk reduction methods will be a key mitigation strategy.</p>

<p>In addition, government-led research and development holds potential for mid-term mitigation strategies. For example, in partnership with the utility industry and the DHS Office of Infrastructure Protection, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) developed a prototype extra high-voltage transformer. Called the Recovery Transformer (RecX) project, <a href="#papg77">[77]</a> this prototype drastically reduced the amount of time needed to repair an extra high voltage transformer in an emergency—from several months to less than one week. Working with its industry partners, S&T successfully demonstrated the RecX prototype for one year, and the pilot ended in March 2013. A final report is currently in development.</p>

<p>To specifically mitigate health and safety impacts, local communities could identify their most critical systems and vulnerable populations, and steps could then be taken to ensure adequate measures are in place in the event of a power outage. For example, backup power systems could be “mandated, not only for acute care facilities, but also for community-based patients dependent on electrically powered lifesaving devices.” <a href="#papg78">[78]</a> This would greatly minimize the impact of shorter-term power outages on public health capacity during emergencies.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p id="papg1">1.&nbsp; Some studies have chosen to examine a nationwide or near-nationwide power outage in the continental United States for at least six months. However, experts differ on how realistic this scenario could be. Because of the uncertainty regarding feasibility of a nationwide power outage, the scenario included here is scoped to a significant but reasonable event.</p>

<p id="papg2">2.&nbsp; For the Physical Attack on the Power Grid event, low, best, and high impact estimates are correlated across impact axes because they represent three physical scenarios (such correlation should not be assumed for other SNRA events). Note that the low, best, and high estimates of likelihood are not correlated to these scenarios: they represent the low estimate, best estimate, and high estimate of the overall frequency of any scenario within the scope of the event (any of the three impact scenarios defining the SNRA’s reported range and any other scenario meeting the thresholds which define the scope of the Physical Attack on the Power Grid event).</p>

<p>The low impact estimates assume a successful attack on the grid infrastructure that causes physical damage, but which does not result in a power outage with significant impacts. This outcome could be because the grid is able to offload power and prevent a power outage or disruption, or because there is an outage of 3 or more hours which occurs at night (critical facilities and industries are assumed to have backup power sufficient for several hours).</p>

<p id="papg3">3.&nbsp; The best impact estimates assume a successful attack on the grid infrastructure that causes physical damage and a power outage to a broad metropolitan area in the continental U.S. at daytime, with the power outage lasting 3 hours. The best estimate duration is based on the lengths of the accidental outages discussed in the Event Background section. In order to estimate the impacts of an outage for the best estimate scenario, this assessment assumes the size of the population affected is 2,138,460. This population size represents the median population size for the 50 largest metropolitan urban areas as captured in the 2010 census.</p>

<p id="papg4">4.&nbsp; The high impact estimates assume a successful attack on the grid infrastructure that causes physical damage and a power outage to a broad metropolitan area in the continental U.S., similar to the best estimate. However, the outage lasts for one day, resulting in net impacts to the Nation similar to those of the Northeast Blackout in August 2003.</p>

<p id="papg5">5.&nbsp; Zero by assumption.</p>

<p id="papg6">6.&nbsp; Scaled from high estimate in proportion to total person-days without power.</p>

<p id="papg7">7.&nbsp; Injuries and fatalities from power grid failures generally result from heat stroke and respiratory ailments, which can occur when outages occur during the summer months. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to directly tie heat stroke victims to a power outage. Determining the role of heat  (versus other concurrent factors) in a death can be complicated, and different jurisdictions use different criteria for considering deaths heat related. For the high estimate, the 90 deaths in New York City associated with the 2003 Northeast Blackout, as determined by Anderson et al (2012), are used.</p>

<p>This figure is likely to be inflated because of the city’s population density; however, studies of the New York City-specific impacts from 2003 blackout remain the most defensible high estimate for the scenarios articulated in the Economic Impacts section of this paper.</p>

<p id="papg8">8.&nbsp; Zero by assumption.</p>

<p id="papg9">9.&nbsp; Scaled to the high estimate in proportion to total person-days without power.</p>

<p id="papg10">10.&nbsp; Mean estimate of excess hospitalizations for complications of respiratory illnesses in New York City for August 14-15 attributed to the loss of electric power in the 2003 Northeast Blackout (Lin et al (2011)) minus the three fatalities due to respiratory illness found (Anderson et al (2012), on the assumption that these deaths were most likely pronounced in hospital. This epidemiological study examined hospitalizations for respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal diseases: only respiratory diseases showed statistically significant hospitalizations over prior year averages (from a subset  with comparable temperature ranges) of the same days in August. Other studies have examined excess hospitalizations for severe diarrheal illnesses caused by eating spoiled meat products due to loss of refrigeration (Marx et al (2006)) and other measures of increased burdens on emergency responders and the hospital system in New York City due to the blackout (Prezant et al (2005)) but did not provide quantitative estimates which could be extracted for this summary sheet.</p>

<p id="papg11">11.&nbsp; SNRA project team assumption.</p>

<p id="papg12">12.&nbsp; SNRA project team assumption.</p>

<p id="papg13">13.&nbsp; The SNRA project team could not find defensible estimates of the number of people displaced from their homes due to the August 2003 blackout, for instance to cooling centers (temperatures were elevated in New York City, Anderson et al (2012)), used as the physical model for the high impact estimates: it is likely this number is non-zero, though perhaps very small.</p>

<p id="papg14">14.&nbsp; Provisional estimate by the 2015 SNRA project team by analogy with the environmental impact estimate description for the Cyber Attack against Physical Infrastructure event, elicited from EPA experts in 2011. Note that this estimate has NOT been reviewed by the original subject matter experts. See Environmental Impacts section.</p>

<p id="papg15">15.&nbsp; Based on data from Department of Energy’s OE-417 Filings from 2011-2014 (most complete data for which physical attacks were tracked). Data are available at www.oe.netl.doe.gov/oe417.aspx. For over 100 incidents representing 1/3 of reported physical attacks, the impacts were listed as unknown. This analysis presumes that there were no impacts from these incidents.</p>

<p id="papg16">16.&nbsp; One incident in the United States FBI (1982) pp 29-30 (Thomas (1981)) in the 80 year period since 1936, chosen as the longest observation period where terror attacks causing blackouts in the United States have been a reasonable possibility. 1936 is sometimes used as a reference point for the maturation of the large-scale, integrated electric grid in the U.S.: it marked the first large scale accidental blackouts and the first appearance in popular culture of the suggestion that the electric grid could be a vulnerable target for terrorists in the Hitchcock film Sabotage. The first large scale deliberate blackouts occurred in the U.S. in 1939, when they were used by striking electrical workers as a tool to pressure employers: the power supply to Times Square and Broadway was shut off in 1941, and the entire city of Pittsburgh was shut down twice in 1946 by striking electrical workers including a month long blackout of the central business district. Nye (2010) pp. 2, 59-64, 70-72, 182.</p>

<p id="papg17">17.&nbsp; Assumes continuing average of one event every four years that causes a confirmed and measurable loss of power and effect on customers. Also assumes that these types of events have the potential to cascade into a blackout.</p>

<p id="papg18">18.&nbsp; Assumes continuing average of about one event with impact (defined as loss of power or an effect on customers) per year and that this type event holds the potential of cascading into a blackout.</p>

<p id="papg21">21.&nbsp; Most recent, complete year of data available from the Department of Energy’s OE-417 filings.</p>

<p id="papg22">22.&nbsp; OE-417 filings are considered emergency forms. Depending on the specific circumstances, they must be filed either within one hour or six hours of the incident.</p>

<p id="papg23">23.&nbsp; Due to similar definitions and time frame for data submission by owners and operators, sabotage, physical attack and vandalism are all considered physical attacks for purposes of this analysis.</p>

<p id="papg24">24.&nbsp; Other incident types include weather and natural disasters, fuel supply deficiency, and operator actions.</p>

<p id="papg25">25.&nbsp; For over 100 incidents representing 1/3 of reported physical attacks, the impacts were listed as unknown. This analysis presumes that there were no impacts from these incidents. For many other incidents, it was reported that there was no load shedding or loss of power to customers, so these are presumed to have had little-to-no effect.</p>

<p id="papg34">34.&nbsp; This scenario is implied by the nationwide option, but it is not clear if a similar 18-month window would apply.</p>

<p id="papg35">35.&nbsp; The large-scale loss of electricity for a few days, or if localized a few weeks at most, is a common enough occurrence that American society is relatively resilient to it: people cope, or (as power is restored in localized areas) go to friends, family, or temporary shelters with power, heat or air conditioning, and water.</p>

<p id="papg36">36.&nbsp; Large or high-voltage transformers must be custom designed and built (U.S. Department of Energy (2014)).</p>

<p id="papg37">37.&nbsp; These plants are located in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Tennessee and Wisconsin (U.S. Department of Energy (2014), Thornton (2015)).</p>

<p id="papg49">49.&nbsp; Although timing is important in determining the impacts, this assessment did not make assumptions about the time of year or time of day.</p>

<p id="papg50">50.&nbsp; While there is research to suggest catastrophic disruption to the grid that could leave a portion of the country without power for an extended period of time, there was not sufficient evidence at the time of this research to estimate the impacts of a catastrophic disruption and further research is warranted.</p>

<p id="papg51">51.&nbsp; Census Bureau (2010). The estimate is derived from taking the mean of the top 50 metropolitan areas according to the 2010 population in the Large Metropolitan Statistical Areas -- Population data set.</p>

<p id="papg52">52.&nbsp; Prezant et al (2005).</p>

<p id="papg53">53.&nbsp; Lin et al (2011).</p>

<p id="papg54">54.&nbsp; Anderson et al (2012), Lin et al (2011). Excess respiratory illnesses: other illness causes, including diarrheal illness from spoiled food, did not result  in detectable excess illnesses (Marx et al (2006)). Each of these studies used epidemiological methods similar to those used for counting excess fatalities due to influenza and influenza-related illnesses.</p>

<p id="papg55">55.&nbsp; Because of New York City’s large population size, this figure is higher than what would intuitively be expected in smaller localities. To cite Anderson et al (2012), “among US cities, New York, NY, may be particularly vulnerable [to fatalities from power outages] because of its many high- rise buildings and substantial dependence on public transportation.”</p>

<p id="papg56">56.&nbsp; Baker (2014).</p>

<p id="papg57">57.&nbsp; According to (U.S. Department of Energy (2014)), a large power transformer is estimated to cost $2 to $7.5 million plus expenses for transportation and installation, which can cost 25 to 30 percent more. A simplified figure of $6 million per transformer is used based on the midpoint of the range of cost plus an additional midpoint percentage increase to reflect transportation and installation expenses.</p>

<p id="papg58">58.&nbsp; This figure is adjusted for inflation in 2015 terms.</p>

<p id="papg59">59.&nbsp; FEMA (2011). FEMA’s BCA methodology is as follows: 1. Estimate the physical damages to the electric power system in dollars, 2. Estimate the functional downtime (system days of lost service), 3. Obtain the number of people served by the electric power utility, and 4. Calculate the economic impacts of lost electric power service, using the per capita economic impacts and the affected population.</p>

<p id="papg60">60.&nbsp; FEMA (2011). Using 2010 numbers, FEMA determined that the direct economic cost of an electricity disruption is $106.27 per capita per day.  $114.39 reflects this value adjusted for inflation in 2015 terms.</p>

<p id="papg61">61.&nbsp; It is worth noting that by using the FEMA BCA methodology on the Northeast Blackout, the direct economic costs in 2003 would equate to $4.48 billion. However, other methodologies can be used to determine the economic cost, but these figures take into account some indirect as well as direct costs. Using a proportional relationship between electricity consumption and national GDP, one calculation of the impacts of the 2003 Blackout showed that “50 million people were without electric power for a day, and so it estimated to have cost $5.6 billion, which is within the range of [other, more complex] estimates that have been published.” (Zimmerman (2005)).</p>

<p id="papg62">62.&nbsp; Continuous manufacturers and digital/IT companies would be examples.</p>
