To compress file size, I converted some PDFs to Word and then re-converted to PDF (this removes embedded fonts that Acrobat can't remove itself).  The internal font conversions this back and forth involves slightly shifts the length and leading of lines.  This isn't an issue for most applications, but it may be for some readers.

The original version of the 'Referenced pages - Pandemic distribution, WH edited page.pdf' file with the original fonts and spacing (because they are pages taken from existing SNRA PDF documents) is at https://web.archive.org/web/20221211021435/https://5usc2302.github.io/risk/5_U.S.C._2302_justification/Other/Referenced_pages_-_Pandemic_distribution,_WH_edited_page_-_5_USC_2302.pdf.
